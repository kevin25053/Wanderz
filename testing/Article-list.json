A host of Rwandan players plying their trade are likely to switch to new teams this coming transfer window as they look to open a fresh chapter in their respective careers. Times Sport takes a look at five Rwandan players abroad who are likely to make moves in January. Ange Mutsinzi The Rwanda international has 18 months left on his FK Jerv contract but he is expected to move after the team was relegated from the Norwegian second tier league. Mutsinzi, who captained Jerv a host of times in the 2023 season, made 30 league appearances scoring twice and providing two assists. He is not short of suitors as he could either sign for another club in the Tippeligaen or move to a top tier side, known as Eliteserien. ALSO READ: Mutsinzi&#039;s future up in the air after FK Jerv relegation Patrick Mutsinzi Mutsinzi&#039;s next destination is likely to be Bulgaria, Brazil or Saudi Arabia. Times Sport can confirm that a host of clubs in these countries have shown interest in the 20-year-old striker. The fast-rising centre forward featured for Al Wahda U21 in the second half of the 2022/23 season where he scored five goals. He also appeared on the bench of the senior teams a couple of times. He is now a free agent after leaving the club on June 30, 2023. Dylan Maes Maes was in fine form for Slovenian second tier league team NK Tolmin in the first round of the league, playing 15 games and scoring once. The towering central defender will move from the newly promoted side in the January transfer window. He told Times Sport a few weeks ago that he is in talks with some clubs in Bulgarie. Yves Mitsindo Mitsindo has been without a club this 2023/24 season. The energetic midfielder was touted as the next biggest thing in Belgian football after captaining their national U16 team but his career hasn&#039;t gone on well due to injuries. Now 20, Mitsindo was released by KV Mechelen U21 on July 1, 2022 and he hasn&#039;t joined any team yet. Currently, he is being courted by some teams in the Belgian third tier with teams like Tienen in the fray. Mitsindo has already switched his allegiance to Rwanda and is eligible to represent the country at U23 and senior national team level. Glen Habimana Habimana was released by Luxemburg Premier League side Victoria Rosport on June 30, 2023 after scoring twice in 15 games. The 22-year-old striker, who has played for Lierse in Belgium and Furstenwalde in Germany, is likely to return to Belgium with some lower tier clubs expressing interest in him. He has been capped four times by Rwanda at senior level since his debut on September 23, 2022 in a friendly game against Equatorial Guinea.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID2": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-27T21:31:45+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-27T21:31:45+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-28T01:23:18+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13386/sports/football/peace-cup-as-kigali-see-off-etincelles-advance-to-second-round", "headline": "Peace Cup: AS Kigali see off Etincelles, advance to second round", "description": "Two second half goals from Kevin Ebene and Janvier Benedata were enough to hand AS Kigali a 2-0 win over Etincelles at Kigali Pele Stadium on Wednesday,...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13386/sports/football/peace-cup-as-kigali-see-off-etincelles-advance-to-second-round"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/27/37705.jpeg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/27/37705.jpeg"}, "articleBody": "Two second half goals from Kevin Ebene and Janvier Benedata were enough to hand AS Kigali a 2-0 win over Etincelles at Kigali Pele Stadium on Wednesday, December 27, hence qualifying for the second round of the 2023/24 Peace Cup with a 3-0 aggregate win.

The agile Rwandan shot-stopper plies his trade in the South African ABSA Premier League where he is enjoying an impressive feat.

ALSO READ: Ntwari&#039;s heroics propel TS Galaxy to Telkom second round Born on September 25, 1999, in Musanze District, northern Rwanda, Ntwari&#039;s journey began on the streets and residential areas of his hometown where he enjoyed playing soccer with friends. His love for the game later led him to the capital, Kigali, where he joined the APR FC Academy in 2015 after featuring for various youth teams in Musanze. While in Kigali, he did not find it easy to kick-on. The prospect of playing for APR\u2019s first team proved challenging as he faced limited playing time due to a number of experienced goalkeepers at the club. Playing for APR\u2019s junior team \u201cIntare FC,\u201d he kept putting in the hard work and soon, his talent began to be noticed by the national team\u2019s technical bench. Ntwari has a rare story, having been called up on the senior national team while playing in the second division. I got my first Amavubi call up in the 2017/2018 season while I was playing for Intare FC in the 2nd division. I was very happy for that call up,\u201d he says. ALSO READ: Players Abroad: Ntwari saves TS Galaxy again in Telkom cup His breakthrough at club level came in 2018 when he moved to Marines FC on a loan deal. While at the club, he got more playing time and managed to showcase his skills which earned him a move to AS Kigali. Since then, things started to change for the youngster as a few years later he would even get a deal outside of Rwanda. Saving penalties Ntwari considers saving penalties talent from God. He says he has been confident in penalty shootouts since his early days in academies and U20 teams. The unique skill has become one of his big assets. Since I was young in academies or U20 teams, I used to save penalties. Until now, I\u2019m confident when it comes to penalties,\u201d he says. As a goalkeeper, he has faced many attackers but he points out Beninese striker Steve Mounie as the best he has played against so far. Against Benin in Cotonou, I made more than five saves but he scored late and the game ended 1-1,\u201d Ntwari recalls. Talking about the best defenders he has had in front of him as a goalkeeper, he noted that the AS Kigali centre back pair of Latif Bishira and Ally Kwitonda was a reliable one. They get the job done and communicate very well on the pitch,\u201d he says.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID6": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-25T11:21:52+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-25T11:21:52+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-25T11:21:51+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13340/sports/football/amagaju-announces-signature-of-two-congolese-players", "headline": "Amagaju announces signature of two Congolese players", "description": "Amagaju FC, on Sunday, December 24, officially announced the signing of two players from the Democratic Republic of Congo: - Abdel Matumona and Rashid...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13340/sports/football/amagaju-announces-signature-of-two-congolese-players"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/25/37559.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/25/37559.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Amagaju FC, on Sunday, December 24, officially announced the signing of two players from the Democratic Republic of Congo: - Abdel Matumona and Rashid Shaban, on a one-and-a-half-year deal.

The report showed that an approximate $ 2.8 billion was made available for the development of sports across the world between 2016 and 2023. With this, FIFA Forward funded over 1,600 specific projects, a third of which relate to football infrastructure. ALSO READ: Ferwafa hotel complete, ready for operations Africa has been a major beneficiary of FIFA&#039;s developmental schemes. In 2020 alone, the world football governing body rolled out eight programs to help in the development of the sport on the continent. Such programs include La Balle aux Prisonniers in Cote D&#039;Ivoire, Play Soccer Ghana, Angaza Sports and Development centre in Kenya and Futebol da For\u00e7a in Mozambique. On a specific note, Rwanda has been on the forefront of FIFA\u2019s support in the CECAFA zone. For instance, in March 2023, the government of Rwanda and FIFA launched a schools&#039; football program in Kigali, an initiative estimated to cost $ 100 million. In addition, with FIFA\u2019s support, a 42-room accommodation facility worth $4.7 million has been constructed in Kigali. It was inaugurated in March 2023 by FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. It will serve as a camping place for various national teams when they come to Rwanda. Annually, FIFA contributes up to $3.4 million to Rwanda&#039;s football for administrative and guidance, $ 2.5 million for infrastructure, and $1.6 million for the different national teams. Furthermore, $900,000 is disbursed for equipment, $800,000 for competitions, $300,000 for the development of women&#039;s football and another $300,000 for capacity development. In general, during the first seven years of FIFA Forward, the institution disbursed approximately $2.8 billion to the 211 FIFA member associations, the six confederations, and various zonal or regional associations, and funded more than 1,600 specific projects with a long-term impact on football development. \u201cWe pledged that revenues generated by football would be used for the benefit of our sport all around the world, for girls and boys, women and men, and we were as good as our word,\u201d said Infantino. \u201cInvestment in football is both our responsibility and our obligation, and through FIFA Forward we have the structure to do that in a viable and transparent way. The outcome has been a sevenfold increase in investment since 2016 \u2013 during a spell in which FIFA\u2019s revenues have not even doubled. This shows that funding is not only being delivered correctly, but it is being monitored and implemented to ensure the sustainable development of football for the long term, he added. From 2023, FIFA Forward promises to go an extra mile by delivering more improved facilities for football development. Each FIFA Member Association is eligible to receive up to $8 million per four-year cycle, with additional funding available for confederations and zonal or regional associations.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID11": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-22T14:56:20+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-22T14:56:20+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-22T14:56:19+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13295/sports/football/senegalese-striker-paul-gomis-set-to-join-rayon-sports", "headline": "Senegalese striker Paul Gomis set to join Rayon Sports", "description": "Senegalese striker Alon Paul Gomis is on the verge of joining Rwandan topflight team Rayon Sports, with his arrival in Kigali on the morning of Friday,...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13295/sports/football/senegalese-striker-paul-gomis-set-to-join-rayon-sports"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/22/37361.jpeg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/22/37361.jpeg"}, "articleBody": "Senegalese striker Alon Paul Gomis is on the verge of joining Rwandan topflight team Rayon Sports, with his arrival in Kigali on the morning of Friday, December 21 marking a significant step in the process.

The forward joined the Mumena-based side from APR in August but he looks set to leave the club sooner than expected over failure to clear his wage arrears for three months. He has, as a result, not reported to training for the past couple days citing illness behind his absence. The player\u2019s future at Kiyovu now hangs up in the air as he now considers terminating his contract with the Mumena-based side as he accuses the club of issuing a bounced cheque with which he was due to withdraw the amount that was remaining on his sign on fee.

My wish, in accordance to the difficult life that I am going through at Kiyovu related to my professional work, it is hard for me to play when I don&#039;t get a salary because it has been three months now without being paid. This is the reason I have asked you to terminate my contract and give me a release letter and look for another team, he added. Kiyovu\u2019s tug of war Kiyovu have been struggling to pay salaries for players during the ongoing 2023/24 season and Mugunga is among players who are unhappy with the situation. While he cited illness behind his recent absence from club training, his employers aren\u2019t convinced with his reasons as long as the club doctor was not informed about his state of health. The club also described his reasons for not reporting to training as \u2018baseless\u2019 and distanced itself from issug a bounced cheque. \u201cThe fact that you have not received your salary should be reason not to report to training because you are not the only player that the club owes the salary,\u201d the club told Mugunga in a letter dated Wednesday, December 20. Mugunga is now suspended from all club\u2019s football activities until further notice as club management examines his situation. Mugunga becomes the second player reported to have handed in a contract termination request due to unpaid salaries after skipper Olivier Niyonzima who is also linked to a move back to Rayon Sports.

Usually, most clubs prefer beefing their squads by signing players plying their trade in the domestic league as they know the terrain and need little or no time to adapt. The first transfer window of 2024 opens from January 1-31 and Times Sport takes a look at five players who could change clubs. Elia Kategeya (Mukura VS to APR FC) It is almost a done deal as Kategeya looks likely to sign for APR FC from Mukura Victory Sports in the January transfer window. A talented central midfielder, Kategeya\u2019s move has become necessary for the army side considering the fact that they do not have a recognized offensive midfielder and also their two main central midfielders Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub and Ismail Nshimirimana have been struggling with injuries which forced them out for weeks without playing. But the youngster is most importantly regarded as a backup for midfielder Claude Niyomugabo who has been playing every minute so far this campaign. ALSO READ: Kategeya hits double as Mukura beat Gasogi United in six goal thriller Christophe Bukuru( Mukura VS to Etincelles) The experienced midfielder was released by Mukura Victory Sports at the end of the 2023/24 transfer window as the two parties decided to part ways through mutual consent. Bukuru is not new to the league, having played for APR, Rayon Sports, Rutsiro and he also had two spells with Mukura Victory Sports. Before joining Mukura in July 2023, he was on the radar of Sunrise FC but the deal fell through. He is now without a club but Times Sport understands that Rubavu-based arch-rivals Etincelles or Marines FC are fighting for his signature although the former are favorites to land him as soon as the January transfer window opens. Moses Nyamurangwa to Sunrise FC The Rwanda U23 defensive midfielder was in the form of his life during the 2022/23 season to the point that he caught the attention of Police who eventually tied him down to a two-year deal during the June 2023 transfer window. He has, however, failed to break into Vincent Mashami\u2019s team and hasn&#039;t even made a single appearance in the ongoing 2023/24 season for the law enforcers who sit second in the Primus National League with 31 points, two behind league leaders APR FC. For now, a loan deal is the only option for Nyamurangwa and his former club Sunrise FC are ready to bring him back as he seeks playing time to regain his confidence. Elijah Ani (Bugesera FC to AS Kigali) There could be another transfer saga as it happened a year ago when Moro Sumaila was made to return to Etincelles after his move to AS Kigali fell through at the last minute. The Citizens are in need of a striker to support Erisa Keith Ssekisambu upfront and the club management has identified Bugesera FC forward Elijah Ani, who has scored 9 goals in the first round of the league, as their main target. The player is ready for a bigger challenge but the onus lies on the Nyamata-based club to release him if AS Kigali tables a reasonable offer. It is very dicey as Bugesera FC would want to hold on to him at least till the season ends. Fiston Nkinzingabo to leave Mukura Times Sport can confirm that talks are underway between the midfielder&#039;s agent and the top hierarchy of Mukura Victory Sports as the player wants his contract terminated. The player has found himself in a frustrating situation at the club since Lotfi Afahmia deployed him in what doesn\u2019t seem to be his preferred position: behind the striker as a number 10. He featured in just five games for the club in the first round and he is eager for a new challenge elsewhere.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID21": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-28T08:23:17+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-28T08:23:17+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-28T11:19:53+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13398/sports/football/five-foreign-based-rwandan-players-who-could-change-clubs-in-january", "headline": "Five foreign-based Rwandan players who could change clubs in January", "description": "The first transfer window of 2024 officially opens on January 1 as clubs look to beef up their squads for the second half of the season.

Times Sport takes a look at five Rwandan players abroad who are likely to make moves in January. Ange Mutsinzi The Rwanda international has 18 months left on his FK Jerv contract but he is expected to move after the team was relegated from the Norwegian second tier league. Mutsinzi, who captained Jerv a host of times in the 2023 season, made 30 league appearances scoring twice and providing two assists. He is not short of suitors as he could either sign for another club in the Tippeligaen or move to a top tier side, known as Eliteserien. ALSO READ: Mutsinzi&#039;s future up in the air after FK Jerv relegation Patrick Mutsinzi Mutsinzi&#039;s next destination is likely to be Bulgaria, Brazil or Saudi Arabia. Times Sport can confirm that a host of clubs in these countries have shown interest in the 20-year-old striker. The fast-rising centre forward featured for Al Wahda U21 in the second half of the 2022/23 season where he scored five goals. He also appeared on the bench of the senior teams a couple of times. He is now a free agent after leaving the club on June 30, 2023. Dylan Maes Maes was in fine form for Slovenian second tier league team NK Tolmin in the first round of the league, playing 15 games and scoring once. The towering central defender will move from the newly promoted side in the January transfer window. He told Times Sport a few weeks ago that he is in talks with some clubs in Bulgarie. Yves Mitsindo Mitsindo has been without a club this 2023/24 season. The energetic midfielder was touted as the next biggest thing in Belgian football after captaining their national U16 team but his career hasn&#039;t gone on well due to injuries. Now 20, Mitsindo was released by KV Mechelen U21 on July 1, 2022 and he hasn&#039;t joined any team yet. Currently, he is being courted by some teams in the Belgian third tier with teams like Tienen in the fray. Mitsindo has already switched his allegiance to Rwanda and is eligible to represent the country at U23 and senior national team level. Glen Habimana Habimana was released by Luxemburg Premier League side Victoria Rosport on June 30, 2023 after scoring twice in 15 games. The 22-year-old striker, who has played for Lierse in Belgium and Furstenwalde in Germany, is likely to return to Belgium with some lower tier clubs expressing interest in him. He has been capped four times by Rwanda at senior level since his debut on September 23, 2022 in a friendly game against Equatorial Guinea.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID22": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-27T21:31:45+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-27T21:31:45+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-28T01:23:18+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13386/sports/football/peace-cup-as-kigali-see-off-etincelles-advance-to-second-round", "headline": "Peace Cup: AS Kigali see off Etincelles, advance to second round", "description": "Two second half goals from Kevin Ebene and Janvier Benedata were enough to hand AS Kigali a 2-0 win over Etincelles at Kigali Pele Stadium on Wednesday,...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13386/sports/football/peace-cup-as-kigali-see-off-etincelles-advance-to-second-round"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/27/37705.jpeg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/27/37705.jpeg"}, "articleBody": "Two second half goals from Kevin Ebene and Janvier Benedata were enough to hand AS Kigali a 2-0 win over Etincelles at Kigali Pele Stadium on Wednesday, December 27, hence qualifying for the second round of the 2023/24 Peace Cup with a 3-0 aggregate win. It was a game whose beauty was spoiled by a soggy pitch as both teams labored to play a desired pattern. Led by Felix Kone in attack, AS Kigali pinned the visitors into their own half but could not find the back of the net as the Etincelles defenders remained resilient before the halftime break. Moise Nyarugabo was a tough customer on the flanks as he cut inside a couple of times pushing to open the scores.He teamed up with Kone in the 20th minute but he wasted the chance as Etincelles recovered the ball.

More players on the radar Ntazinda insists that APR FC still need to improve the squad in various departments. After signing midfielder Elia Kategeya from Mukura VS and bringing back Thaiba Mbonyumwami who was on loan from Marine FC, the club is still eyeing more potential signings during the upcoming January transfer window. We are currently monitoring some players, but I can&#039;t go into details at the moment, he said. Thierry Froger\u2019s men will depart for Zanzibar on December 29, where they will participate in Mapinduzi Cup with their first game scheduled for January 1, 2024.

The agile Rwandan shot-stopper plies his trade in the South African ABSA Premier League where he is enjoying an impressive feat. Having played just two games for his team TS Galaxy, the 24-year-old has already hit the limelight by saving four penalties and propelling his club to the semi-finals of the Telkom Cup. ALSO READ: Ntwari&#039;s heroics propel TS Galaxy to Telkom second round Born on September 25, 1999, in Musanze District, northern Rwanda, Ntwari&#039;s journey began on the streets and residential areas of his hometown where he enjoyed playing soccer with friends. His love for the game later led him to the capital, Kigali, where he joined the APR FC Academy in 2015 after featuring for various youth teams in Musanze. While in Kigali, he did not find it easy to kick-on. The prospect of playing for APR\u2019s first team proved challenging as he faced limited playing time due to a number of experienced goalkeepers at the club. Playing for APR\u2019s junior team \u201cIntare FC,\u201d he kept putting in the hard work and soon, his talent began to be noticed by the national team\u2019s technical bench. Ntwari has a rare story, having been called up on the senior national team while playing in the second division. I got my first Amavubi call up in the 2017/2018 season while I was playing for Intare FC in the 2nd division. I was very happy for that call up,\u201d he says. ALSO READ: Players Abroad: Ntwari saves TS Galaxy again in Telkom cup His breakthrough at club level came in 2018 when he moved to Marines FC on a loan deal. While at the club, he got more playing time and managed to showcase his skills which earned him a move to AS Kigali. Since then, things started to change for the youngster as a few years later he would even get a deal outside of Rwanda. Saving penalties Ntwari considers saving penalties talent from God. He says he has been confident in penalty shootouts since his early days in academies and U20 teams. The unique skill has become one of his big assets. Since I was young in academies or U20 teams, I used to save penalties. Until now, I\u2019m confident when it comes to penalties,\u201d he says. As a goalkeeper, he has faced many attackers but he points out Beninese striker Steve Mounie as the best he has played against so far. Against Benin in Cotonou, I made more than five saves but he scored late and the game ended 1-1,\u201d Ntwari recalls. Talking about the best defenders he has had in front of him as a goalkeeper, he noted that the AS Kigali centre back pair of Latif Bishira and Ally Kwitonda was a reliable one. They get the job done and communicate very well on the pitch,\u201d he says.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID26": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-25T11:21:52+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-25T11:21:52+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-25T11:21:51+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13340/sports/football/amagaju-announces-signature-of-two-congolese-players", "headline": "Amagaju announces signature of two Congolese players", "description": "Amagaju FC, on Sunday, December 24, officially announced the signing of two players from the Democratic Republic of Congo: - Abdel Matumona and Rashid...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13340/sports/football/amagaju-announces-signature-of-two-congolese-players"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/25/37559.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/25/37559.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Amagaju FC, on Sunday, December 24, officially announced the signing of two players from the Democratic Republic of Congo: - Abdel Matumona and Rashid Shaban, on a one-and-a-half-year deal.

The report showed that an approximate $ 2.8 billion was made available for the development of sports across the world between 2016 and 2023. With this, FIFA Forward funded over 1,600 specific projects, a third of which relate to football infrastructure. ALSO READ: Ferwafa hotel complete, ready for operations Africa has been a major beneficiary of FIFA&#039;s developmental schemes. In 2020 alone, the world football governing body rolled out eight programs to help in the development of the sport on the continent. Such programs include La Balle aux Prisonniers in Cote D&#039;Ivoire, Play Soccer Ghana, Angaza Sports and Development centre in Kenya and Futebol da For\u00e7a in Mozambique. On a specific note, Rwanda has been on the forefront of FIFA\u2019s support in the CECAFA zone. For instance, in March 2023, the government of Rwanda and FIFA launched a schools&#039; football program in Kigali, an initiative estimated to cost $ 100 million. In addition, with FIFA\u2019s support, a 42-room accommodation facility worth $4.7 million has been constructed in Kigali. It was inaugurated in March 2023 by FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. It will serve as a camping place for various national teams when they come to Rwanda. Annually, FIFA contributes up to $3.4 million to Rwanda&#039;s football for administrative and guidance, $ 2.5 million for infrastructure, and $1.6 million for the different national teams. Furthermore, $900,000 is disbursed for equipment, $800,000 for competitions, $300,000 for the development of women&#039;s football and another $300,000 for capacity development. In general, during the first seven years of FIFA Forward, the institution disbursed approximately $2.8 billion to the 211 FIFA member associations, the six confederations, and various zonal or regional associations, and funded more than 1,600 specific projects with a long-term impact on football development. \u201cWe pledged that revenues generated by football would be used for the benefit of our sport all around the world, for girls and boys, women and men, and we were as good as our word,\u201d said Infantino. \u201cInvestment in football is both our responsibility and our obligation, and through FIFA Forward we have the structure to do that in a viable and transparent way. The outcome has been a sevenfold increase in investment since 2016 \u2013 during a spell in which FIFA\u2019s revenues have not even doubled.

Usually, most clubs prefer beefing their squads by signing players plying their trade in the domestic league as they know the terrain and need little or no time to adapt. The first transfer window of 2024 opens from January 1-31 and Times Sport takes a look at five players who could change clubs. Elia Kategeya (Mukura VS to APR FC) It is almost a done deal as Kategeya looks likely to sign for APR FC from Mukura Victory Sports in the January transfer window. A talented central midfielder, Kategeya\u2019s move has become necessary for the army side considering the fact that they do not have a recognized offensive midfielder and also their two main central midfielders Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub and Ismail Nshimirimana have been struggling with injuries which forced them out for weeks without playing. But the youngster is most importantly regarded as a backup for midfielder Claude Niyomugabo who has been playing every minute so far this campaign. ALSO READ: Kategeya hits double as Mukura beat Gasogi United in six goal thriller Christophe Bukuru( Mukura VS to Etincelles) The experienced midfielder was released by Mukura Victory Sports at the end of the 2023/24 transfer window as the two parties decided to part ways through mutual consent. Bukuru is not new to the league, having played for APR, Rayon Sports, Rutsiro and he also had two spells with Mukura Victory Sports. Before joining Mukura in July 2023, he was on the radar of Sunrise FC but the deal fell through. He is now without a club but Times Sport understands that Rubavu-based arch-rivals Etincelles or Marines FC are fighting for his signature although the former are favorites to land him as soon as the January transfer window opens. Moses Nyamurangwa to Sunrise FC The Rwanda U23 defensive midfielder was in the form of his life during the 2022/23 season to the point that he caught the attention of Police who eventually tied him down to a two-year deal during the June 2023 transfer window. He has, however, failed to break into Vincent Mashami\u2019s team and hasn&#039;t even made a single appearance in the ongoing 2023/24 season for the law enforcers who sit second in the Primus National League with 31 points, two behind league leaders APR FC. For now, a loan deal is the only option for Nyamurangwa and his former club Sunrise FC are ready to bring him back as he seeks playing time to regain his confidence. Elijah Ani (Bugesera FC to AS Kigali) There could be another transfer saga as it happened a year ago when Moro Sumaila was made to return to Etincelles after his move to AS Kigali fell through at the last minute. The Citizens are in need of a striker to support Erisa Keith Ssekisambu upfront and the club management has identified Bugesera FC forward Elijah Ani, who has scored 9 goals in the first round of the league, as their main target. The player is ready for a bigger challenge but the onus lies on the Nyamata-based club to release him if AS Kigali tables a reasonable offer. It is very dicey as Bugesera FC would want to hold on to him at least till the season ends. Fiston Nkinzingabo to leave Mukura Times Sport can confirm that talks are underway between the midfielder&#039;s agent and the top hierarchy of Mukura Victory Sports as the player wants his contract terminated. The player has found himself in a frustrating situation at the club since Lotfi Afahmia deployed him in what doesn\u2019t seem to be his preferred position: behind the striker as a number 10. He featured in just five games for the club in the first round and he is eager for a new challenge elsewhere.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID41": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-19T12:32:45+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-19T12:32:45+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-19T12:40:32+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13214/sports/football/kategeya-edges-closer-to-apr-fc-move", "headline": "Kategeya edges closer to APR FC move", "description": "Mukura Victory Sports midfielder Elia Kategeya has agreed personal terms with APR FC as his move to the army side beckons.

Some individual performances had an instrumental impact in their teams\u2019 current standings on the table led by reigning champions APR with 33 points. The army side is, however, looking their shoulders, with pressure from Police FC (31 points), Musanze (29 points) and Rayon Sports (27) looming. As the league is on a one-month festive break, Times Sport takes a look at players who made the different in their respective positions during the first round. ALSO READ: Five key highlights from the first round of the Primus National League Goalkeeper: Pavelh Ndzila (APR) The Congolese shot stopper was not convincing for APR in the CAF Champions League campaign in which they were handed a premature elimination by Pyramids FC but he has been superb on the domestic front. Ndzila conceded just nine goals in 15 league matches, the least so far this season. He single-handedly saved APR against Mukura in which he pulled as many as five point blank saves. RB: Cedric Kubwimana (Mukura VS) The enterprising right back had in rich vein of form, scoring four goals and providing two assists despite playing in defense. A marauding lateral defender, Kubwimana contributes immensely to both defensive and attacking duties. He has been a key element for his club. LB: Christian Ishimwe (APR) Ishimwe missed some games as sometimes coach Thierry Froger tried to rotate him with Claude Niyomugabo. However, he has made his contributions noticed whenever he was on duty at the left side of APR FC defense. CB: Isaac Mitima (Rayon Sports) The towering central defender has a great command at the back and has always been efficient. With skipper Abdul Rwatubyaye still trying to find his best form, Mitima has been the main man at the back for Rayon Sports. He excelled greatly in games against Gasogi, Mukura, and Police FC. CB: Clement Niyigena (APR FC) Niyigena might not have played a lot of games for APR this season but anytime he is on the field, he brings stability to the APR back four. He has paired Prince Buregeya, Yunus Nshimiyimana as well as Salomon Bindjeme and has excelled greatly. DM: Joseph Sackey (Muhazi United) Sackey has been dominant for Muhazi United putting up superb performances against Gorilla FC, Sunrise and APR. He has two goals and two assists to his name so far this season which is commendable for a holding midfielder. CM: Abdul Rahman Rukundo (Amagaju FC) Rukundo has been the heart and soul of newly promoted Amagaju with some breathtaking displays. Rukundo has netted 7 goals from the midfield in 15 games, and he has been efficient for the club. He is the reason why they are occupying a mid-table position. Left Wing: Heritier Luvumbu ( Rayon Sports) Luvumbu could operate either behind a striker or on the left wing depending on Mohamed Wade\u2019s formation of play. The Congo international has scored six goals for the Blues this season and has been their key man. Once Luvumbu has his day, expect Rayon to win. His most outstanding moment was on October 21 when he bagged a hat-trick against Sunrise FC. Right wing: Muhadjiri Hakizimana (Police FC) Hakizimana did not start the season well after Police blocked his $70,000-a-year move to Iraq. At one point, he was even suspended from the team for poor output and attitude after defeat to APR. The experienced midfielder was, however, able to put all behind him and he has now become the live wire of Police FC. He has 8 league goals to his name so far this campaign and has been exceptional for the club. Attack: Peter Agblevor (Musanze FC) Agblevor has scored 10 league goals in his last 12 league appearances this season. Musanze FC has been depending on the Ghanaian and they, at the same time, struggled in his absence especially when he was handed a three match suspension games after he was suspended for a horror challenge of AS Kigali goalkeeper Yves Kimenyi. ALSO READ: Hit or Miss? How have new signings fared Centre forward: Victor Mbaoma (APR FC) The Nigerian striker has been a revelation for defending Champions APR in the first round of the league. Mbaoma has scored 12 league goals, and his goals were crucial to the team\u2019s table topping in the forts round. The most notable one was his last gasp goal against Mukura in the 94th minute on October 13. Mbaoma is a Fox in the box and he can get the job done at any time.

Copenhagen, who earned a memorable win against Manchester United on their way to finishing second in Group A, are the lowest-ranked side left in the competition. Elsewhere, Barcelona were drawn to face Napoli, notable for being two former clubs of late Argentina legend Diego Maradona. United States stars Ricardo Pepi and Sergino Dest will face international teammate Giovanni Reyna with Borussia Dortmund and PSV Eindhoven drawn against each other. Arsenal, in their first appearance in the round of 16 since 2016-17, face two-time winners FC Porto, while Bayern Munich were matched up with Lazio. Paris Saint-Germain, who finished runners-up in Group F behind Borussia Dortmund, drew Spanish side Real Sociedad. Madrid&#039;s clash with Leipzig comes as they were dealt another major injury blow, as defender David Alaba tore an ACL in their 4-1 LaLiga win over Villarreal on Sunday. Club director of institutional relations Emilio Butrague\u00f1o said Madrid are unsure whether they will replace the defender in the upcoming January transfer window. As Carlo [Ancelotti] said, we&#039;ll see in the next few days what we decide [to do]. The team has showed it&#039;s capable of facing any challenge. We&#039;ll wait over the next few days and see what we do, he said. We&#039;re facing a difficult situation; it&#039;s surprising to have so many injuries, and serious ones. [Thibaut] Courtois, [Eder] Milit\u00e3o and Alaba will be out now. Despite that, we&#039;re in a fantastic moment. But obviously the injury to Alaba is a setback; we&#039;ll have to work together to overcome it. The round of 16 kicks off with group winners hosting the first-leg matches, which will be played Feb. 13, 14, 20 and 21. Return legs will be played on March 5, 6, 12 and 13.

But their hopes for a comeback were thwarted by Abdu Nizeyimana who scored the home side\u2019s fourth goal in the 86th minute to cement a hard fought 4-2 win. With the win, AS Muhanga closed the gap at the top of Group B within two points moving to second place with 16 points while Vision FC remain top of the table standings with 18 points despite the loss.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexis Kayinamura"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID46": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-17T15:17:57+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-17T15:17:57+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-17T15:17:55+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13147/sports/football/as-muhanga-vision-fc-match-set-for-replay", "headline": "AS Muhanga, Vision FC match set for replay", "description": "AS Muhanga Vs Vision FC (Muhanga Stadium) Kickoff: 3PM The second Division League match between AS Muhanga and Vision FC will resume at Muhanga Stadium...", "keywords": "Second Division League,AS Muhanga,Vision FC", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13147/sports/football/as-muhanga-vision-fc-match-set-for-replay"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/17/36858.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/17/36858.jpg"}, "articleBody": "AS Muhanga Vs Vision FC (Muhanga Stadium) Kickoff: 3PM The second Division League match between AS Muhanga and Vision FC will resume at Muhanga Stadium Sunday, December 16 at 3PM.

This was the introduction of a story published in The New Times of Wednesday, December 13. If this line popped up on your phone screen as a notification and somehow, you don&#039;t read the rest of the story, you may be tempted to assume the player must have done something out of the ordinary to warrant his actions as assault. Fair enough, the photo looks somewhat provocative to the eye but, if you are a sports person, you find that players normally have/get physical contact with match officials--it&#039;s not encouraged or allowed but it&#039;s normal! In the world of sports, controversies often arise, and football is no stranger to heated moments that spark debates and discussions. Akayezu finds himself in the midst of a storm after that eye-catching photo circulated on social media, capturing a moment that led to allegations of (sexual) assault against referee Umutoni. Despite the noise surrounding the incident, the Rwanda Football Association (FERWAFA) and Umutoni demonstrated commendable judgment in not pursuing charges against Akayezu. First and foremost, it is crucial to acknowledge the match official&#039;s role in maintaining the integrity of the game. Referee Umutoni, entrusted with upholding the laws of football, exhibited a high level of professionalism by not allowing external pressure to influence her decision-making. In situations where players may attempt to dispute a call, referees must remain resolute and focused on the rules of the game. Umutoni&#039;s silence on the alleged incident in her match report speaks volumes about her commitment to fair play and the principle of not letting external factors interfere with her duties. What&#039;s more, the absence of any mention of the incident in Umutoni&#039;s match report underscores her confidence in handling the situation appropriately during the game. Umutoni knows what she signed for, and Indeed she stayed steadfast in her ability to handle a man&#039;s game. Referees are trained to identify and report any misconduct or violations accurately, and Umutoni&#039;s omission of the alleged assault on her, in her report, suggests that she did not perceive it as a significant breach of the rules. This aligns with the notion that referees are entrusted to make real-time judgments on the field, and their reports serve as a comprehensive account of the match&#039;s events. FERWAFA&#039;s decision to not pursue charges against Akayezu further reinforces the importance of a measured assessment of incidents that occur during matches. While public opinion may vary, the football governing body must adhere to a fair and consistent disciplinary process. In this case, the absence of a formal complaint from the referee, combined with the lack of a clear breach of the rules, led FERWAFA to rightly prioritize maintaining the integrity of the sport over succumbing to external pressures. It&#039;s crucial to recognize that not every on-field incident requires legal intervention. Referees have the authority to manage and control matches, and their decisions are final within the context of the game. In situations where players may engage in heated exchanges or attempts to influence officials, the football community and general public should trust the expertise of the referees and the game&#039;s governing body to handle matters appropriately. Referee Umutoni and FERWAFA&#039;s decision not to pursue charges against Akayezu reflects a commitment to the principles of fair play and adherence to the rules of the game. Their actions demonstrate a dedication to maintaining the integrity of football by allowing the on-field officials to exercise their judgment without unnecessary external interference. Long may this firmness continue. So, when feminists like Sylvie Nsanga claim that the player assaulted Umutoni and goes ahead to call on Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) to pick interest in the incident, I wonder, if that would not be stretching the boundaries of the laws of the game. According to The New Times\u2019 article, Nsanga suggests that a gender mainstreaming strategy involving human rights and women&#039;s rights organisations should be prioritized to ensure safety and protection of women in sports. \u201cYou have to put strong mechanisms to detect sexual harassment and prevent it,\u201d she posted on her X account. While I respect her opinion and support her proposal, my view is that controversies will always be a part of football, and it is essential to appreciate and support decisions that prioritize the sport&#039;s core values and the authority of those responsible for upholding them, otherwise, we risk having on-field decisions being taken in boardrooms. That will be the end of football!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hamza Nkuutu"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID48": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-15T14:14:20+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-15T14:14:20+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-16T09:14:54+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13122/sports/football/mukansanga-becomes-first-rwandan-video-assistant-referee", "headline": "Mukansanga becomes first Rwandan Video Assistant Referee", "description": "Referee Salma Mukansanga, a listed international referee for FIFA since 2012, has become the first Rwandan Video Assistant Referee (VAR).

During his first day in Rwanda, Timber visited the Genocide Memorial Centre and paid respects to the victims of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. It&#039;s important to understand the history of Rwanda and what happened here. I appreciate the peace that exists in the country now, he said. The 22-year-old took some time to talk to young footballers, and shared a bit of his story. My mother is my biggest inspiration. She is very special to me.

It was an action-packed display, characterised by stunning goals, fiercely contested matches, outstanding individual performances, and, notably, a high turnout of spectators at various stadiums. Here are key takeaways from the first fifteen games of the season: 1. Six coaches fired Clubs wasted no time to dismiss underperforming coaches. In just four months, six coaches were let go: Yamen Zelfani of Rayon Sports, Eric Nshimiyimana of Bugesera, Maurice Nshimiyimana of Etoile, Hassan Muhire of Sunrise FC, Andre Casa Mbungo of AS Kigali, and Petros Koukuras of Kiyovu Sports. ALSO READ: Nshimiyimana sacked as Bugesera FC head coach For teams like Sunrise FC and AS Kigali, such moves played out well, as they climbed out of the drop zone. 2. Race for the golden boot intensifies The competition for the top scorer award in the 2023/24 season has heated up, with three players firmly in the race. Victor Mbaoma of APR FC leads with 12 goals in 15 games, followed by Peter Agblevor with 10 goals in 11 games, and Muhadjiri Hakizimana of Police and Elijah Ani of Bugesera with 9 goals each. These players, vital to their teams, are expected to continue their goal-scoring spree in the second round, and may surpass Leandre Onana&#039;s 15 goals that secured the award in the 2022/23 season. 3. APR&#039;s unbeaten streak In the 15 games, APR FC demonstrated dominance by winning 9 and drawing 6 without any defeats. Though the team\u2019s display has not been convincing in some games, especially during the goalless derby against Gasogi where coach Thierry Froger faced criticism from fans, the army side\u2019s unbeaten record is such a big feat. 4. Musanze&#039;s resurgence Historically a mid-table team, Musanze FC emerged as a potential title contender in the so far. The team was in third position by the time the first round closed. Coach Sosthene Habimana has crafted a winning team capable of challenging the big clubs for the trophy, led by standout players like Peter Agblevor. 5. A round of fantastic goals A variety of good goals have been scored in the first round of the league. Notable among them is Muhadjiri&#039;s long range strike against Musanze, Elie Kategeya&#039;s lob against Gasogi, Samuel Pimpong&#039;s precise and well placed shot against Kiyovu, and Elie Tatou&#039;s long-range effort against Rayon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID51": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-14T10:46:12+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-14T10:46:12+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-14T15:06:01+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13084/sports/football/video-arsenal-defender-jurrien-timber-elated-to-visit-rwanda", "headline": "VIDEO: Arsenal defender Jurrien Timber elated to visit Rwanda", "description": "Arsenal FC\u2019s defender Jurrien Timber who is currently in Rwanda for a visit has described the experience as an \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d...", "keywords": "Visit Rwanda,Kigali,Arsenal,Jurrien Timber", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13084/sports/football/video-arsenal-defender-jurrien-timber-elated-to-visit-rwanda"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/14/36629.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/14/36629.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Arsenal FC\u2019s defender Jurrien Timber who is currently in Rwanda for a visit has described the experience as an \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d one. Alongside his girlfriend, the Dutch international landed at Kigali International Airport on Thursday, December 14 to start his three-day visit which will involve various activities including meeting and interacting with youngsters. The trip is part of Visit Rwanda\u2019s multi-year partnership with Arsenal FC. It is an amazing experience. Lots of people can say the same, I was excited to come. And even as I am here, I am more excited to be honest, he said during a media interview he had at the airport. This is Timber\u2019s first visit to the African continent. He will experience Rwanda\u2019s remarkable hospitality and culture, travel to Akagera National Park to enjoy a Big 5 safari, interact with Arsenal fans in Kigali and Nyagatare, as well as visiting the Kigali Genocide Memorial to pay respects to the victims and to learn more about the Genocide against the Tutsi. The 22-year old defender is the second Arsenal men\u2019s first team player to visit the country since the partnership\u2019s launch, following in the footsteps of former Arsenal defender David Luiz who visited Rwanda in 2019. \u201cMy expectation is to have a nice time. We have a full program, so I am going to enjoy the time. My girlfriend came with me. I think we can have a good time,\u201d he noted. Over the years, Arsenal legends Edu Gaspar, Robert Pires, Alex Scott, Tony Adams, Lauren, Ray Parlour, David Seaman, Sol Campbell, and women first team players Caitlin Foord, Jordan Nobbs, Jen Beatie, and Katie McCabe have visited Rwanda. Timber, a central defender cum right back joined Arsenal from Ajax during the summer transfer window, but has made just one appearance for the team due to injury. He says he is getting better and closer to fitness. I am feeling good. It (recovery from injury) is a long process. A lot of hard work! I can&#039;t complain about how it is going now,\u201d he said.

Visit Rwanda\u2019s partnership with Arsenal, as the club\u2019s inaugural Sleeve Sponsor and Official Tourism Partner has been highly successful in making Rwanda a must-see holiday destination for football fans and tourists around the world. An independent survey conducted by Hall and Partners of Arsenal fans across 30 markets found that 75 percent of Arsenal fans were not aware of Rwanda as a tourism destination, and, as a result of the partnership, 51 percent of fans are now more likely to consider Rwanda as a tourist destination, demonstrating a shift in perception and understanding of the country.

Each of the 16 topflight clubs were active on the market with a host of mega signings as they aimed to beef up their squads. It has been a rollercoaster since the 2023/24 Primus National League started on August 23 with some of the players already living up to expectations while others are struggling to impress despite big money moves. As the first round of the league winds up, Times Sport takes a look at standout players and flops among new signings. Hits Victor Mbaoma (APR FC) APR signed Mbaoma as a free agent in July after the striker left Uzbekistan side Qizilgun Zarafshon. Despite struggling at the CAF Champions League, he has been in fine form, scoring 12 league goals in 15 games. APR has over the years struggled for a formidable goal scorer and Mbaoma seems to be their ultimate answer to their woes. Mbaoma has been scoring for fun and, should he continue where he stopped in the first round, the Nigerian is undoubtedly destined to finish as the league top scorer. Elijah Ani (Bugesera FC) Bugesera FC are struggling in the Primus National League but Ani has been on fire. The Nigerian striker has banged in 9 league goals for the relegation-threatened team, including superb strikes against Kiyovu Sports and Police FC. Haringingo will be counting on the forward\u2019s goals as he looks to rescue the Nyamata-based club from the relegation. Joseph Sackey (Muhazi United) It virtually looks like the biggest transfer bargain that Muhazi United has made. The Ghanaian defensive midfielder has been their best player in the first round of the season. Signed from Ghanaian second tier side Wa Suntaa FC where he won the player of the season during in 2023, Sackey has continued his excellent form in the Rwandan Primus National League. In 15 games, he scored two goals and provided two assists. Not so bad for a defensive midfielder. ALSO READ: Sackey predicts tough game against Rayon sports Richard Kilongozi (Kiyovu) The Burundian winger has exhibited fantastic output for a Kiyovu Sports team whose form has been patchy due to internal administrative disorders. Kilongozi has has been at the heart of the Mumena-based side\u2019s redemption and his influence in big games has been key for the club. He has bagged six goals and provided a couple of assists so far this season. Arguably one of the most feared forwards in the league. Abedi Bigirimana (Police FC) The Burundi international started the season on a poor note as he looked bulky and out of form considering that he was settling for new life at Police FC. He, however, was able to quickly rediscover his form with the assistance of Vincent Mashami and his technical team.

With the midfield duo, Police FC have established themselves among APR\u2019s big threat to the league title. Misses Moses Nyamurangwa (Police FC) Nyamurangwa moved to Police FC in July after excelling for Sunrise FC in the 2022/23 season. The youngster has failed to stake a claim in the Police FC team as he continues to struggle for game time in the club\u2019s pecking order considering that he has not made a single appearance for the club. If Nyamurangwa does not up his work rate and break into Mashami\u2019s team at all cost, he could be offloaded in June. Moro Sumaila (Police FC) The Ghanaian striker was a hit at Etincelles last season scoring ten goals in the first round of the 2022/23 season. He had to force a move to Police FC months after his transfer to AS Kigali in January fell through. Moro did not have a preseason with his new club as he completed his move after four rounds of games in the league and, by that time, the squad was intact. The Ghanaian has played only cameo roles at Police FC this season, always coming on as a late substitute. He scored just once in the first round of the season. Mikel Freeman (Kiyovu SC) The Liberian striker was in fine form for Oilers in his home country scoring for fun before joining Kiyovu in July. He has failed to cement a place in the team losing his position to Richard Kilongozi, the club\u2019s current main man. The 1.94m forward could be released in June if he doesn&#039;t improve. Youssef Rharb (Rayon Sports) Now having his second spell at Rayon Sports, a lot was expected from the Moroccan attacker as the club hope he would play an instrumental role in their CAF Confederation Cup campaign. READ ALSO: Youssef Rharb set for shock Rayon return However, he has been a pale shadow of himself. Youssef\u2019s poor disciplinary record still haunts him as he was banished from the first team only for him to be brought back when he turned a new leaf.

Time to recover his form before the second round comes or he will be released. Danny Ndikumana (APR FC) APR FC thought they signed the next biggest football hopeful in Ndikumana but the former Rukinzo FC prodigy has failed to glitter. He is now a forgotten man, having failed to even make the cut in Thierry Froger\u2019s bench. Ndikumana has not made a single appearance for the army side this season and the club could consider loaning him so he could get playing time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID53": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-13T14:23:41+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-13T14:23:41+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-13T14:23:40+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13066/sports/football/seninga-insists-no-team-is-making-the-difference-in-the-league", "headline": "Seninga insists no team is making the difference in the league", "description": "Former Sunrise FC coach Innocent Seninga claims the level of the teams in the Primus National League is almost the same as not a single side proved to be...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13066/sports/football/seninga-insists-no-team-is-making-the-difference-in-the-league"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/13/36576.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/13/36576.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Former Sunrise FC coach Innocent Seninga claims the level of the teams in the Primus National League is almost the same as not a single side proved to be unstoppable over the course the first round.

Akayezu has been at the centre of controversy since a photo of him apparently touching Umutoni\u2019s chest went viral as he tried to convince the referee not to show him a second yellow card for a bookable offense over winger Arsene Tuyisenge in the 76th minute of the match during which his side beat Rayon Sports 2-1 at Kigali Pele Stadium on Saturday, December 9. READ ALSO: Ten-man AS Kigali shock Rayon Sports The photo sparked divided opinions in the public with some describing it as an attempt to assault the referee while others suggested that the player was involved in an \u2018accidental physical contact\u2019 with her in an apparent attempt to avoid being sent off. From her observation, feminist Sylvie Nsanga claimed that the player assaulted Umutoni before calling on Rwanda Investigation Bureau to pick interest in the incident.

However, Akayezu strongly dismissed alleged assault claims as opposed to allegations from the public. The defender told Times Sport that, \u201cI never meant to disrespect or insult the referee during the incident. My only intention was to plead for forgiveness and avoid a red card.\u201d \u201cI deeply regret what happened, but it was never my intention (sexual assault).

FA reacts While the photo made rounds and sparked divided opinions, local football governing body (FERWAFA) investigated the matter based on the referee\u2019s report after the match before contacting her for further verification. \u201cWe looked into the referee&#039;s report and she never mentioned that she was subject to any form of assault. I also spoke to the her for further clarification and she said that the player didn&#039;t touch her,\u201d FERWAFA spokesperson Jules Karangwa told Times Sport. Karangwa said that the FA will not any further action against Akayezu other than maintaining his one-match suspension after he was sent off for a second bookable offense during AS Kigali\u2019s match against Rayon Sports. The suspension, as a result, saw him miss club\u2019s goalless draw against Muhazi United at Ngoma Stadium on Tuesday, December 12.

Heritier Luvumbu could even have snatched an injury time winner for Blues only to miss a sitter in the 95th minute to the relief the Mumena-based side. Coach Muhamed Wade used a 4-3-3 formation against the Green Baggies with Eric Ngendahimana being paired with Abdul Rwatubyaye in the heart of defence while Roger Kanamugire joined Kevin Muhire and Heritier Luvumbu in midfield, replacing Rashid Kalisa who was serving a one-match suspension. Kiyovu, on the other hand, opted for a 4-2-3-1 formation with Fred Muhozi behind lone ranger Richard Kilongozi. It was a nervy start for both teams but Kiyovu calmed the tempo as they took control of the game in early stages. Kiyovu right back and former Rayon star Karim Nizigiyimana overlapped on the right and delivered a cut back cross to Shariff Bayo who hit a ferocious drive outside the box to fire the visitors ahead in the 12th minute. The goal awoke the Blues as they quickly regrouped to dominate the game pushing for an equalizer. They started most of their attack from the back where skipper Abdul Rwatubyaye was superb. ALSO READ: Rayon Sports host Kiyovu in dicey derby Rayon had the chance to even the scores in the 18th minute but Musa Esenu fluffed his effort wide from the right side of Kiyovu\u2019s vital area. Muhire, who was pulling the strings in the midfield, was brought down at the edge of the Kiyovu penalty box but the resultant free kick was agonizingly wasted by Heritier Luvumbu in the 30th minute. Kiyovu were very tactical as they soaked the pressure and occasionally broke loose on counter attacks as they made some vital incursions but Rayon\u2019s back four curtailed the danger. With five minutes to end the first half, Ali Serumogo moved forward and used Muhire as a decoy before hitting a short which missed the target to the relief of Kiyovu goalkeeper Djihad Nzeyurwanda. The first half ended with Kiyovu leading 1-0 though Rayon had been a dominant force in terms of ball possession. The second half begun with Rayon in control as they pinned Kiyovu into their own half. The Blues tried to utilize the pace of Ojera to great effects as they often released the balls to him to cut in. But the Ugandan forward looked far from impressive on the evening as he struggled to make the best of the chances at his disposal. Rayon\u2019s attackers posed major threats in Kiyovu\u2019s penalty box on numerous occasions but Eric Ndizeye and Felicien Hakizimana had formed a defensive wall that was too tough to break. With two minutes to end the game, Ngendahimana, who had a fantastic game, popped up with the equalizer in the 88th minute to deny a win for Kiyovu SC. Kiyovu suffered in the stoppage time as they tried to defend at least a point against a Rayon side which wanted nothing but a win to close the gap to four points between them and league leaders APR FC. And the fans thought Luvumbu was going to win it late for the Blues before failing to tap in Ojera\u2019s cross in the last minute. There was not much chances in injury time as the referee blew his whistle for the end of the game. Other games Police FC made mince meat of Musanze FC as they thrashed them 3-0.

Kiyovu, now sixth on the league table with 20 points after 14 games, have been patchy this season while Rayon have been in fine form before falling to a 2-1 loss to AS Kigali on December 9. They now sit third with 26 points. Form does not count in local derbies and Rayon themselves can attest to it after surprise loss at the hands of the \u2018Citizens\u2019 who were deep in the relegation zone. It is going to be an intriguing game with much at stake. During the 2022/23 season, Rayon failed to beat Kiyovu both home and away in the league as the Green Baggies picked four points out of six. The Blues will be hoping to write a new script as they face another litmus test. In terms of player quality, Kiyovu will rely on Burundian striker Richard Kilongozi who has scored in each of his last three games for the club while skipper Olivier Niyonzima will be looking to show what his former side has been missing from him since he left the club IN 2019. Rayon will also count on Joackiam Ojera and the evergreen Heritier Luvumbu who has been arguably the best midfielder in the Primus National League so far this season.

Osimhen, who led Napoli to win the Italian League title last season, beat Paris Saint-Germain&#039;s Morocco right-back, Achraf Hakimi and Liverpool&#039;s Egypt winger, Mohamed Salah, to win the top award. It&#039;s a dream come true for me, Osimhen said. I appreciate Nigerians for their support. I appreciate Africa for putting me on the map, encouraging me, and defending me, regardless of my shortcomings, the 24-year-old added. Osimhen excelled last season for Napoli, after scoring 31 goals in all competitions and contributing to them winning the Italian League title after a drought that lasted 33 years. Napoli estimate Osimhen&#039;s market value at approximately \u20ac200 million. Osimhen was spotted by European scouts at the 2015 edition of the under-17 World Cup in Chile and joined German outfit Wolfsburg. He was loaned to Charleroi and later joined the Belgian club permanently. His next move was to French side Lille in 2019, where he scored 13 goals in 27 appearances. Napoli signed him one year later for \u20ac70 million, but he contracted Covid-19 during a visit to Nigeria and later suffered a head injury and a fractured skull and eye socket. Those injuries led Osimhen to wear a protective mask and sections of the media called him the masked assassin. He missed the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon due to the injuries, and Nigeria suffered a shock last-16 loss to Tunisia. INJURY PRONE Osimhen was the leading scorer with 10 goals in qualifying for the 2024 Cup of Nations, which the Ivory Coast will host from January 13. His total included four in a 10-0 rout of Sao Tome e Principe -- a record winning margin for a qualifier in the competition. Injury-prone Osimhen was sidelined again two months ago after suffering a hamstring injury in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia. The regular absences of the Nigerian angered Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis, who reacted by saying he would sign no more Africans unless they agreed to skip the Cup of Nations. Morocco last year became the first African and Arab country to reach the World Cup semifinals and goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, his teammates and coach Walid Regragui were honoured in Marrakesh. Bounou was named goalkeeper of the year, Regragui coach of the year and Morocco the national team of the year. Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala completed a Nigerian double by winning the African Women&#039;s player of the year for a record-extending sixth time. Born in Ikorodu, north-east of commercial capital Lagos, her previous successes came in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022. After playing for Nigerian clubs Robo and Rivers Angels, she had spells with Liverpool, Arsenal and Dalian Quanjian before an initial loan move to Barcelona became permanent four years ago. Oshoala scored in a win over co-hosts Australia that helped Nigeria reach the 2023 Women&#039;s World Cup round of 16, where they lost to England on penalties.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Agencies"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID59": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-12T00:32:48+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-12T00:32:48+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-12T08:14:21+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13026/sports/football/pnl-five-talking-points-from-goal-galore-weekend-action", "headline": "PNL: Five talking points from goal galore weekend action", "description": "It was goals galore in week 14 of the Primus National League as a total of 25 goals were scored across the league centres.

APR, Police and Mukura Victory Sports were the only clubs who won away from home while five players namely Victor Mbaoma, Erisa Ssekisambu, Samson Babua, Solomon Adeyinka and Elie Kategeya all scored doubles as each of their repective teams emerged victorious. Times Sport takes a look at five things we learnt from the week 14 games. Mukura deadly wingers proving vital Mukura Victory Sports\u2019 forward line has been deadly especially from their wingers. The Huye-based thrashed Kiyovu 4-1 on December 6 before traveling to Kigali to beat Gasogi United 4-2 on Saturday, December 9. The impeccable form of the Yellow and Blacks is largely down to their flamboyant wingers where in their last two games, Elie Tatou, Samuel Pimpong and Zuber Hakizimana have made six goals contributions. They have scored three and also assisted three goals. The trio do not start games together but either of them makes their mark when he comes on. ALSO READ: Kategeya hits double as Mukura beat Gasogi United in six-goal thriller Babuwa leading Sunrise survival Sunrise has been struggling since the start of the season but now their top marksman has come to the rescue recently. Babuwa hadn&#039;t played for some time but, once he got back to the field, he was on fire. He was on target during cluib\u2019s 2-1 win over Gorilla before adding a brace on Friday, December 8 as Sunrise beat Amagaju 2-1, going on to lift the team out of the drop zone. ALSO READ: In form Babuwa insists he is proving critics wrong Froger bounces back after fans booing Thierry Froger and his men were booed by the fans after they were held to a goalless draw by Gasogi United. The French gaffer reiterated that he understands the fans\u2019 frustration but vowed to improve in the next games. He responded the critics with an emphatic 4-1 win over Gorilla FC on Friday, December 8 at Kigali Pele Stadium. The defending champions need to be consistent and churn out such results every week as Musanze FC and others are on their heels. They were again unstoppable when they traveled to Huye Stadium to beat Amagaju FC 2-1 on Monday, December 11. Etoile de l&#039;Est going from bad to worse Etoile looked not prepared for the topflight league. They recently appointed Nigeria&#039;s Amapakabo Kwaku as their new head coach after sacking Maurice Nshimiyimana. However, the Eastern Province-based club looks far from improved. Their woes continued when they were thrashed 3-0 by Police FC at Ngoma Stadium on Saturday. Etoile last won a league game on November 5 when they beat Gasogi 1-0. It is early days and there are still 16 more games to play but if Etoile don&#039;t lift up their game in the second round of the league and get some good results, they would be relegated. Ssekisambu shows quality against Rayon AS Kigali have had a poor season in the league but their redemption could be on the horizons following Saturday\u2019s 2-1 victory over Rayon Sports despite playing with a man down during the last 13 minutes of the match. Striker Erisa Ssekisambu\u2019s performance was top notch. The Ugandan forward was lively as he completely mesmerized the Rayon Sports defenders. He proved to be the live wire of AS Kigali against one of their biggest rivals.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID60": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-11T19:23:08+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-11T19:23:08+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-11T20:01:07+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13015/sports/football/mbaoma-scores-brace-again-as-ruthless-apr-dismantle-amagaju-fc", "headline": "Mbaoma scores brace again as ruthless APR dismantle Amagaju FC", "description": "Red hot striker Victor Mbaoma continued his goalscoring form as his double inspired APR FC to a 3-1 victory over Amagaju FC at Huye Stadium on Monday,...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13015/sports/football/mbaoma-scores-brace-again-as-ruthless-apr-dismantle-amagaju-fc"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/11/36409.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/11/36409.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Red hot striker Victor Mbaoma continued his goalscoring form as his double inspired APR FC to a 3-1 victory over Amagaju FC at Huye Stadium on Monday, December 11.

Both teams started the encounter brightly but APR looked more aggressive as they pinned Amagaju into their own half. Thierry Froger\u2019s high pressing approach paid off in the 16th minute when Jean Claude Dusabe bundled the ball into his own net to give the visitor&#039;s a deserved lead.

The home side started to create some decent chances as they made inroads into the vital area of the army side and they eventually reduced the deficit in the 52nd minute through Seth Nkurunziza. Froger brought on Innocent Nshuti and Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub for Prince Buregeya and Alain Kwitonda respectively as they pushed for the fourth goal but Amagaju\u2019s back four, led by Janvier Dushimirimana, stood resolute at the back as the game ended 3-1 in favor of APR.

The result left the defending champions at the top of the table with 27 points, nonetheless. In the same breath, the draw gave their rivals a glimmer of hope, whether false or real, in the race for the league title, but at the end of the day, the army side, so more often than not, just seems to have so much in their armoury to fight their way to the league victory, always. ALSO READ: PHOTOS: Underfire Froger booed as Gasogi United hold APR FC Rayon Sports will always be in the picture, and they are APR&#039;s main threat, unfortunately, just a threat is what they have been so frustratingly frequently for their liking. APR have been so dominant, having been crowned league champions 21 times in 28 seasons, including the last four on the trot. Such has been the club&#039;s dominance. Their rivals can&#039;t seem to have anything to do about it. Rival fans will definitely have, on their minds, other reasons, perceived or otherwise, as to why their teams are so ridiculously dominated, but from a neutral standpoint, APR&#039;s domination of Rwandan football is a testament to their formidable combination of financial backing, rich pedigree and consistent success on the pitch. However, it&#039;s very unfortunate that APR&#039;s dominance on the local scene doesn&#039;t transcend Rwandan boarders. This has been the club&#039;s biggest Achilles heel, and if performances and results don&#039;t improve in CAF competitions, then APR stands to be forever remembered, as the old proverb goes, &#039;the one-eyed man&#039; being the king! History has a way of judging so harshly. Of course, there are a number of factors that contribute to APR&#039;s consistent struggles in CAF competitions but for me, the main one is the limited exposure to higher-caliber teams in the domestic league--this, believe it or not, hinders their ability to compete at the continental level. On the home front though, the recent surprise goalless draw against Gasogi United might have raised eyebrows, leading to fans booing their coach, Thierry Froger, but it is crucial to delve into the broader context of APR&#039;s historical performance, and current strengths to understand why they are likely to maintain their stronghold on the Primus National League. ALSO READ: Froger on APR fans boos: I understand their frustrations Established in 1994, APR FC has been a powerhouse in Rwandan football ever since, winning the league title 21 times since the club made its league debut in 1995. This remarkable record underscores their unparalleled success and consistent dominance over more than two decades. One key factor contributing to their sustained excellence is the financial backing that the club enjoys. With the resources to attract top talent, better training conditions and renumerations, and secure the services of capable coaches, APR stands head and shoulders above all of its domestic rivals. The financial muscle of the club enables them to assemble squad after squad comprising some of the best players in Rwandan football, and very often, beyond. The ability to recruit and retain top talent ensures a consistent level of performance throughout the league season. Furthermore, pedigree plays a pivotal role in the dominance of APR FC. The club&#039;s rich history in national football and consistency of success, create a winning culture that spreads throughout. They may have their limits, especially on the continent but back home, their firm grip on proceedings is as tight as anything. Because they are paid well and timely, taken care of rather more professionally by the club, APR players, coaches, and staff are instilled with a sense of pride and responsibility to uphold the legacy of the club. This ingrained winning mentality becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as each individual associated with the club strives for excellence, contributing to the club&#039;s overall dominance. You can&#039;t say the same for either Rayon Sports or any other club. On the tactical front, APR FC boasts a well-structured and expensively assembled squad, that for a man, their players are a cut above the rest in the league, which is why the draw against Gasogi, though unexpected, is just a minor blip in a season-long journey. APR will overcome such hurdles and maintain their dominance. Rayon Sports, as is with every season, emerges as the main threat to APR&#039;s dominance. The rivalry between these two powerhouses adds an extra layer of intrigue to the Rwandan league. However, APR&#039;s financial prowess, combined with their historical success, provides them with a psychological edge over their rivals. The ability to navigate high-stakes encounters in a calm and composed manner is a hallmark of champions, and as history shows, APR&#039;s pedigree often shines through in crucial moments. I, like anyone with Rwandan football at heart, wish if only that winning culture at APR FC, which makes them so successful, could spread into CAF Champions League or Confederation Cup, a level where, as opposed to their home dominance, they so often flatter to deceive.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hamza Nkuutu"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID70": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-07T21:03:35+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-07T21:03:35+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-07T21:03:34+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12939/sports/football/guinean-striker-camara-signs-six-month-deal-with-rayon-sports", "headline": "Guinean striker Camara signs six-month deal with Rayon Sports", "description": "Rayon Sports have announced the signing of Guinean striker Als\u00e9ny Camara in a deal that will keep him at the club for the remainder of the season.

We came back in the second half, we rectified but we weren&#039;t fair enough and it gave us this little point of success.

However, he has been frozen out by the coach after the pair reportedly had a fallout, prompting the tactician to drop him out of his starting 11. Shaiboub also spent 90 minutes on the bench during APR draw against Gasogi, leaving the fans disappointed at full time as they sang his name. Asked about Shaiboub\u2019s snub, Froger revealed that selection of players was in his discretion and he cannot fill all the expatriate players.

It has been a good show so far for the junior Amavubi who secured their spot to the last four after defeating Sudan 3-0 on Friday in the last match of the group stages. It was Rwanda\u2019s second win, after Somalia (1-0), in three matches played in group stages. They opened the campaign with a 1-0 victory over Somalia before falling to a 1-0 loss to hosts Kenya. The latter finished top of Group A with 9 points, three ahead of second Rwanda with 6 points.

Overall, not many goals (13) were scored in the weekends while Gorilla FC, Gasogi United and Amagaju FC were the only teams who recorded away wins. Times Sport takes a look at five talking points from weekend action. The Hakizimana revolution continues Muhajiri Hakizimana had his mind set on playing for Iraqi outfit Zakho FC his move failed after Police reject the club\u2019s $70,000 bid to sign him in August. He was never happy since then and it affected his performance at the start of the season, leading to a fallout with his coach Vincent Mashami who on numerous occasions looked unimpressed by his displays. Hakizimana realized that things weren\u2019t going well when Frank Spittler snubbed him in the national team which was preparing for the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers against Zimbabwe and South Africa. The offensive midfielder has since worked hard to return to his top form during the international break and it now paying dividends for Police. He single-handedly made the difference as his brace helped Police FC beat Marines FC 2-1 at Kigali Pele Stadium on Saturday. With Hakizimana, Police FC have been looking unstoppable and his form could be decisive in club\u2019s quest for the first league title in their history. ALSO READ: Hakizimana hits double as Police FC beat Marines Musanze not the same without suspended Agblevor Musanze FC has been struggling without Ghanaian striker Peter Agblevor who has been serving suspension following a horror challenge on Yves Kimenyi on October 29, which led the AS Kigali shot stopper to need surgery on his torn tibia and fibula. Since Agblevor\u2019s suspension, Sosthene Habimana\u2019s side has not been the same team as their attacking line has been performing poorly upfront. Mohammed Sulley has chipped in some goals but the impact has been minimal as compared to Agblevor who has been a big miss for the Musanze-based side. The former Etoile de l&#039;Est talisman is Musanze FC\u2019s, live wire and, without him, they had surrendered the top spot, with APR FC leading the way. He was dearly missed as the club lost 1-0 at home to Gorilla at Ubworoherane Stadium on Saturday. It is evident that more misery could haunt Musanze FC as long as they don\u2019t have their goal poacher in attack.

They got their acts together and came out with some great results including a 2-1 away win over Eastern Province rivals Sunrise FC at Nyagatare Stadium on October 21. Etincelles on Sunday, Emmanuel Ruremesha\u2019s men came from behind to win 3-1, their biggest win this season. From all indications, the team, formerly Rwamagana City FC, are only getting even better as the season progresses. There is no stopping for Gilbert Mugisha After his exploits on international football duty with Amavubi in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Mugisha has been on fire ever since. The forward scored once and also set up a penalty in his last three matches. He has been APR&#039;s key player so far this season, whether he scores or not, he remains a nightmare for defenders. Mugisha remains one of the torchbearers of APR FC and he would be vital if they are to retain the league title. Title race might go down the wire After 12 league games, there is a pretty narrow gap between the four top teams with APR leading the standings with 26 points. They are closely followed by Vincent Mashami\u2019s Police FC with 25 as well as Rayon Sports and Musanze FC who are tied at 23 points in third and fourth places respectively. Meanwhile, four teams namely Amagaju, Kiyovu, Gasogi, and Mukura Victory Sports all have 17 points. The points gap is so close and it is evident that title race might go down to the final day as it did during the past two seasons. Now, only injuries and experience will make the difference in the decisive stages if any of the teams is to win the title.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID82": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-04T13:05:45+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-04T13:05:45+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-04T13:05:43+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12829/sports/football/players-abroad-bizimanas-fine-form-continues-as-ntwaris-galaxy-reach-cup-final", "headline": "Players Abroad: Bizimana\u2019s fine form continues as Ntwari\u2019s Galaxy reach cup final", "description": "It was yet another memorable weekend for Rwandan footballers plying their trade abroad as a number of them put up excellent performances in their...", "keywords": "Rwandan Players Abroad", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12829/sports/football/players-abroad-bizimanas-fine-form-continues-as-ntwaris-galaxy-reach-cup-final"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/04/35598.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/04/35598.jpg"}, "articleBody": "It was yet another memorable weekend for Rwandan footballers plying their trade abroad as a number of them put up excellent performances in their respective teams.

This marks the third year of partnership between the two parties, with the initial agreement signed in 2021. Sophie TCHATCHOUA, the Managing Director of CANAL+ Rwanda, expressed her delight in renewing the partnership with the most popular football club in Rwanda. She described the past two years as a great success for both sides. We are very pleased to continue our partnership with Rayon Sports. The past two years have been a success, and that&#039;s why we decided to extend for one more year, said TCHATCHOUA. Rayon Sports, known for having the largest fan base in the country, with an estimated three million supporters, has been striving to leverage this support to attract corporate sponsorships. Jean Fidel Uwayezu, the Chairman of Rayon Sports, spoke about the club&#039;s financial stability and the need for consistent revenue to support their projects. When I took on the role of club president, three years ago, our first ambition was to ensure the financial stability of our team. \u201cRayon Sports, being a fans-owned team, needs its reliable source of revenue, Uwayezu stated during a press conference on Friday. Rayon Sports recently announced a budget of approximately Rwf1 billion for the 2023/24 season. Uwayezu said that the new contract with CANAL+Rwanda is worth more than the previous one although specific details were kept confidential. I can&#039;t specifically mention the exact worth of this new contract due to confidentiality reasons, but what I can say is that it&#039;s bigger than last year, said Uwayezu. In addition to financial support, CANAL+Rwanda provides subscriptions for 45 Rayon Sports first-team players and committee members, as well as decoders and other equipment. Festive season CANAL+ Rwanda is offering some amazing festive season promotions! They have lowered the price of their decoders to just Rwf5,000, and that includes all the accessories like antennas, cables, and remote controls.

This triumph, coupled with a previous 0-0 draw against Zimbabwe, positions Rwanda at the top of Group C with four points. ALSO READ: Rwanda moves seven places up in November FIFA rankings The significance of that win is amplified by Rwanda\u2019s previous struggles, having not secured a victory in a competitive match for over two years. The unexpected success against South Africa has ignited aspirations of a potential miracle \u2013 qualifying for the World Cup. However, Rwanda faces stiff competition in their group, notably from Nigeria, who are currently in third place with two points from two drawn matches. South Africa sits in second place with three points. ALSO READ: 2026 WC Qualifiers: Nshuti and Mugisha fire Rwanda past South Africa While Rwanda\u2019s recent success is encouraging, the upcoming matches, especially away from home, will be crucial in determining their qualification prospects. Accumulating four points from the opening two fixtures, both played at home, was key and the least Amavubi had to settle for, thankfully, they did. Considering Nigeria\u2019s consistent performance at international football and South Africa\u2019s competitive standing, Rwanda must maintain their momentum and capitalize on every opportunity. Playing at the World Cup is nothing new to Rwanda\u2014the U-17 national team\u2019s previous World Cup appearance in 2011 showcases the country\u2019s potential, but the senior team faces a challenging road ahead. ALSO READ: Rwanda qualifies for Fifa U-17 World Cup Finals The journey to the World Cup finals tournament is often filled with twists and turns, and Rwanda\u2019s unexpected triumph over South Africa has sparked hopes of a potential miracle qualification. I call it a miracle, not that it\u2019s mission impossible but because no one, not even themselves, expects Amavubi to top the group. The fact that the team secured a goalless draw against Zimbabwe in their opening match further underscores their resilience and capability to compete at this level, under new coach Torsten Frank Spittler. Rwanda leads Group C table standing with four points, closely followed by South Africa with three points and Nigeria in third place with two points level with Lethoso and Zimbabwe while Benin currently sits bottom of the group with a single point. This sets the stage for a highly competitive battle for the top spot and the coveted World Cup qualification. What&#039;s more, Rwanda can finish second in the group and still remain in the race to the USA-Canada-Mexico showpiece, via playoffs, provided they have more points than any other second-placed teams from the other groups. Africa has been allocated ten spots (a two-fold increase), of which nine qualify automatically as group leaders and the 10th will go through playoffs. The FIFA play-off tournament will see six sides fight it out for the final two places. It will involve two teams from CONCACAF (North America) and one team apiece from the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONMEBOL (South America) and OFC (Oceania). According to FIFA, the four lowest-ranked nations will meet in bracket semi-finals. The two highest-ranked teams will go directly into the final. The winners of the two bracket finals will reach the FIFA World Cup. Nigeria, a football powerhouse in Africa, poses a formidable challenge for Rwanda. Despite being in third place, Nigeria\u2019s pedigree and experience make them a formidable opponent. For Rwanda, to secure qualification, they must approach the upcoming fixture against the Super Eagles with a strategic mindset, capitalizing on any weaknesses and maintaining the momentum gained from the victory over South Africa. South Africa is another crucial contender in the group. The loss to Rwanda is undoubtedly a setback, but they remain well-positioned to bounce back in the remaining fixtures. The return leg between Rwanda and South Africa will be pivotal in determining the group dynamics and could potentially shape the fate of both teams in the qualification race. Rwanda\u2019s chances of qualifying for the World Cup hinge not only on their individual performances but also on the outcomes of matches involving other teams in the group. With Nigeria drawing both their matches, the group appears to be open, providing an opportunity for Amavubi to capitalize on any slip-ups by their more illustrious competitors. Key factors that could influence Rwanda\u2019s qualification prospects include the team\u2019s consistency, tactical adaptability, and the ability to perform under pressure. The latter factor will be key. The support and enthusiasm of Rwandan fans are invaluable assets that can propel the team forward\u2014the joyous celebrations following the victory over South Africa is a testament to the emotional investment of the fans in the success of the national team. It\u2019s early days, and we can\u2019t start counting chicks before eggs hatch, but boy, Rwandans can enjoy Amavubi\u2019s position while it lasts, and yes, it may not be a wise idea to jump the gun but again, Amavubi fans are allowed to dare to dream, after all, that\u2019s what dreams are there for.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hamza Nkuutu"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID92": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-11-30T18:07:12+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-11-30T18:07:12+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-11-30T18:07:10+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12753/sports/football/rayon-sports-make-u-turn-on-youssefs-future", "headline": "Rayon Sports make U-turn on Youssef\u2019s future", "description": "Rayon Sports have decided to keep forward Youssef Rharb after fruitful talks on Wednesday.

They had their first chance in the fifth minute as Ismail Nshimirimana latched on to a superb ball from Alain Kwitonda but his effort flew over the post. Sunrise FC took long to settle in the game but they were able to string a couple of passes together though they failed to find their target man Yafesi Mubiru.

Sunrise, however, maintained their resilience as the visitors struggled to break the deadlock until the teams headed for the half time break. Thierry Froger\u2019s charges started from where they left off in the first half with their free-flowing football leaving the home side with no clue. The visitors made crucial attacking threats but they failed the capitalize on their chances as Sunrise FC were let off the hook on numerous occasions. Mbaoma remained lively in attack as he switched to the right side. He was brought down in the 75th minute just outside the penalty box as he tried to dribble into the 18-yard box. Nshimirimana elected himself to effect the free kick and he curled a sublime effort which hit the post to the relief of goalkeeper Didier Mfashingabo. With six minutes to full time, Gilbert Mugisha produced the moment of the game. He dribbled past two Sunrise players before being hacked down inside the penalty box. The referee pointed to the spot as he awarded a penalty to the army side. Mbaoma stepped up and sent Mfashingabo the wrong way to give APR a 1-0 lead in the 85th minute. APR pushed for the second goal to ensure safety for their three points but Sunrise stood resolute at the back until the referee blew his final whistle.

With the Blues leading 1-0, Police stepped up their game as they sought for the equalizer. They had a glorious chance in the 19th minute as Muhadjiri Hakizimana stole the ball from Eric Ngendahimana from the midfield. His pass found Didier Mugisha but the striker&#039;s effort hit the post to the relief of the Rayon\u2019s fans. Despite being a goal down, Vincent Mashami\u2019s men tried to drag the Rayon Sports players out so that they could exploit the spaces at the back in an attempt to equalize. Hesbone Rutonesha\u2019s pass found Abedi Bigirimana who also located Hakizimana with a one-time delivery before firing a shot which was saved by Rayon goalkeeper Simon Tamale. Police FC were dominating ball possession until match officials had to temporarily suspend the game after 35 minutes of action as the pitch was waterlogged due to heavy rains. As soon as it stopped raining, match officials and coaches from both sides agreed to resume the match instead of suspending it to the next day just like Kiyovu and Sunrise did over the weekend. There were no further chances in the final 10 minutes of the first half as both teams went for a half time break with Rayon leading 1-0. The second half saw coach Mohammed Wade bringing on Rashid Kalisa for Roger Kanamugire as he sought to stabilize his midfield. Police FC tried to use the pace of skipper Dominique Savio Nshuti on the flanks to great effects as he proved to be a tough customer for Blues defenders. Rayon launched an attack pushing to double the lead but Joackiam Ojera was denied a penalty as he claimed that defender Ally Kwitonda brought him down while clearing the danger. Head coach of Rayon Wade was not happy with the decision as he questioned the referee and got a yellow card. Police never ceased to press as they tried to get an equalizer and, to soak pressure, Wade introduced Elie Ganijuru in the 75th minute to replace Charles Bbaale who failed to impress in as the tactician opted to only play on counterattacks. With two minutes to end the game, Heritier Luvumbu punished Police in the 88th minute with the second goal as he put the game beyond the reach of the law enforcers.

The Tanzanian forces\u2019 side started with a clear plan to defend as they sat deep in a compact 5- 4- 1 formation and allowed possession but leaving no space for the opponents to score while at the same time building their game counterattacks. The biggest opportunity came in the 23rd minute when RDF 5 Division\u2019s Sudi Kamuzinzi overlapped down the right flank and squared the ball into the box area. Mashaga Changalane let the ball run between his legs and Bosco Iradukunda almost scored the opener when he outstripped Hamis Linolo but his angled drive was well saved by goalkeeper Mohamed Seif. TPDF 202 Brigade turned to open play as striker Julius Chiloletti struck a volley which unfortunately went wide in the 42nd minute to the relief of the home side. While both teams had decent opportunities in the opening half neither could convert their chances, hence headed for a half time break with a goalless draw. After recess, both teams started the second half pushing to capitalize their chances until Rhino Rangers (TPDF) burst into life in the 57th minute when Adam Kindemba broke the deadlock after lobbing a loose ball 15 yards in front of the goal. The playmaker took a touch before lashing a thunderbolt in the top corner to give the visitors the lead. RDF instantly equalized three minutes later through Eric Habimana who drove into the opponent&#039;s area after the TPDF defender lost the ball, he chipped the keeper who could do nothing only to see the ball roll into the back of the net. RDF doubled the lead in the 69th before TPDF leveled the scores again before referee blew the final whistle. Both teams had to be separated by penalty shootouts after which TPDF emerged victorious after beating RDF 5 Divion 5-4. After the Game, Col Justus Majyambere said that the aim of the friendly match was to strengthen the available relationship between RDF 5 DIV 1 forces in the Eastern Province with TPDF 202 Brigade which oversees seven provinces in Tanzania including Kagera which borders the Eastern region of Rwanda. \u201c The game is one of mutual relationships that has been existing between RDF 5 Div and TPDF 202 Brigade,\u201d said Majyambere. Prior to the game, he said, RDF received the TODF delegations and discussed security including cross-border crime activities. \u201cWe met before but decided that we should have a friendly match in order to build the trust, cooperation, and unity between RDF and TPDF,\u201d he noted. Meanwhile, RDF 5 Division will visit TDF 202 Brigade in a second leg match scheduled in February 2024 in either Tabora or Kagera, Tanzania.

On a rainy afternoon at the Kigali Pele Stadium, it took the defending champions just six minutes to take the lead through a fantastic finish from Victor Mbaoma who now leads the charts as the league joint-top scorer. APR&#039;s midfield was marshalled around Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub who was playing his first game after returning from injury. The Sudanese midfielder was the engine of the military side as he drove the team forward with his commanding display which included his ability to support both the defense and the attack. APR piled pressure on AS Kigali but Latif Bishira and others stood resolute as they thwarted most of their efforts. The first half ended with the army club leading 1-0.

Coach Andre Casa Mbungo pushed more men forward in an attempt to get an equalizer. The pressing paid dividends as the visitors leveled the scores ealr in the second half through Fiston Ishimwe. AS Kigali had an infringement inside the APR penalty box in the 48th minute and they were awarded a spot kick. Former APR player Fiston Ishimwe stepped up and beautifully hit it past Pavelh Ndzila to make it 1-1. APR coach Thierry Froger decided to beef up his attack, taking off Apam Assongwe and Shaiboub for Gilbert Mugisha and Innocent Nshuti who were both on scoresheet as Rwanda stunned South Africa 2-0 in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday, November 21. The changes brought a lot of urgency to APR\u2019s attacking department as they took control of the game. After numerous missed chances, APR had a penalty in the 83rd minute following a foul in the AS Kigali 18-yard box. Innocent Nshuti stepped up but saw his penalty saved by AS Kigali goalkeeper Niyonkuru. That was few minutes after the striker had his goal ruled out after Victor Mbaoma fouled Niyonkuru before Nshuti scored. The final seven minutes of the game saw both teams trying to find a late winner but the defenders of both sides held their might at the back as the game ended 1-1. Other Games In-form Abedi Bigirimana and Aboubakar Akuki Djibrine scored for Police FC as they defeated Amagaju 2-1 at the Huye Stadium to make it six victories in a row for Vincent Mashami\u2019s side who closed the gap at the top of the table with just a point adrift of leaders Musanze and APR. Elsewhere at Nyamata Stadium, Francis Haringingo&#039;s first game as Bugesera FC head coach ended in defeat as they were pipped 1-0 by visitors Marines FC while Rayon Sports were held to a 1-1 draw by Etincelles at Umuganda Stadium in Rubavu..

The November qualifiers leave Rwanda with head held high at the top of Group C standing after collecting four points from two matches. German head coach Frank Spittler started his job in a convincing manner and proved doubters wrong, achieving a massive 2-0 victory over South Africa at Huye Stadium on Tuesday a week after drawing goalless with Zimbabwe at the same ground in the opening game of the qualifiers. ALSO READ: 2026 WC Qualifiers: Nshuti and Mugisha fire Rwanda past South Africa The recent results have not only boosted confidence among Spittler\u2019s men in the dressing room but it also caught the attention of nation\u2019s football legends who continue to show support to the team that bigger things will come if they keep momentum in the future outings against group opponents Nigeria, Lesotho, and Benin. Rejoice! Veteran D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mbonabucya captained Rwanda at the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Tunisia, the only appearance the country has ever made at the continent\u2019s most prestigious football event. The Belgium-based legend watched from the stands when Innocent Nshuti and Gilbert Mugisha punish Bafana Bafana in two big moments that reminded him of the time Amavubi stunned Uganda and Ghana to qualify for the AFCON finals. Mbonabucya, who last watched Rwanda playing back in years, said the current group can replicate the 2004 Amavubi glory days and beat anyone regardless of being underdogs in the group. I can\u2019t hide my satisfaction with the way we were going about our business against South Africa. We can build on this win against one of the best teams in Africa and do better in the next matches, the former Sint-Truiden defender said. And, despite being snubbed from featuring in the Rwandan squad recently, Singida stars striker Meddie Kagere could barely hide his emotions after learning that his country stunned South Africa. Kagere, who has been playing for the national team for a over a decade, a admits it is a result he never expected considering the pain of defeats that the country had experienced for a couple of years, putting many on the edge of losing hope for results. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s the result that every Rwandan wanted but no one was expecting that performance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got wise players who are playing very well, especially in the first half. The football, they played, bringing it out from the back, creating many passes, and moving the ball was the best football that team was playing, I am happy for the young boys,\u201d former Police, Rayon Sports and Simba FC noted.

Then Rwandans will give them the backing in their capacity to get to needed results which have been missing for quite some time. We have to support these boys because they have shown that they are capable of winning many games and I think everyone in Rwanda is happy so I am happy for them and I am looking forward to seeing boys winning many games, Mbonabucya said. Moving forward, former Amavubi defensive midfielder Jean-Baptiste &#039;Migi&#039; Mugiraneza said that it is time to think on how Rwanda can build the momentum and get used to winning more games. \u201cIt is something to rejoice as Rwandans because it has been so long without winning at home with better performance. All I can tell the boys is to keep working hard because anything can happen if they keep working hard for the next matches,\u201d the Musanze FC assistant coach told Weekend Sport. \u201cWe saw Amavubi which is different from the past, I saw different football. They attacked, they are united and they worked hard but they are not that far yet, they have to prepare their mind since they showed that they can beat every team in this group.\u201d You can beat anyone! With that stunning win over South Africa, Rwanda sent a strong message to Group C rivals, including qualification favorites Nigeria, that anyone can taste a similar result against the \u2018underdogs.\u2019 Rwanda&#039;s most capped player Haruna Niyonzima said that the team can beat anyone if they maintain fitness and creativity. \u201cAn exciting young side has captured the imagination of a nation starved of success for far too long.

The Standard Liege midfielder was unimpressed by Spittler\u2019s decision to take him off for Kevin Muhire during goalless draw against Zimbabwe last week in the opening game of the 2026 World Cup Africa qualifiers. The player at the time expressed his frustration by throwing a bottle in front of the bench shortly after leaving the pitch. Spittler left the youngster out of his starting 11 against South Africa despite his outstanding performance against Zimbabwe, raising concerns about a potential rift between the two. Kevin Muhire took Sahabo\u2019s place in medfield against Bafana Bafana in what the coach pointed out that it was a tactical change.

He is our most creative player and one of the best we have in the team, Spittler told journalists in a post-match press conference. Letting him start from the bench against South Africa was purely a tactical decision. He is very young and a great offensive player. In this game, we needed someone who can do additional defensive job in midfield and Kevin was the right person. ALSO READ: Sahabo unimpressed by Spittler&#039;s substitution While starting Sabaho came as a surprise to many, Spittler explained that he discussed the decision with the player before the match. I told Sahabo before the selection about my tactics, I told him I needed Kevin to start because of his energy. I told him he would come on when the South Africans are exhausted and he understood it professionally, the German explained. The coach is convinced by Sahabo\u2019s exceptional talent but insists that he is still too young to carry the team\u2019s burden on his shoulders. He is only 18 years old and he has a bright future. Sahabo will be one of the top players on the future.

A host of Rwandan players plying their trade are likely to switch to new teams this coming transfer window as they look to open a fresh chapter in their respective careers. Times Sport takes a look at five Rwandan players abroad who are likely to make moves in January. Ange Mutsinzi The Rwanda international has 18 months left on his FK Jerv contract but he is expected to move after the team was relegated from the Norwegian second tier league. Mutsinzi, who captained Jerv a host of times in the 2023 season, made 30 league appearances scoring twice and providing two assists. He is not short of suitors as he could either sign for another club in the Tippeligaen or move to a top tier side, known as Eliteserien. ALSO READ: Mutsinzi&#039;s future up in the air after FK Jerv relegation Patrick Mutsinzi Mutsinzi&#039;s next destination is likely to be Bulgaria, Brazil or Saudi Arabia. Times Sport can confirm that a host of clubs in these countries have shown interest in the 20-year-old striker. The fast-rising centre forward featured for Al Wahda U21 in the second half of the 2022/23 season where he scored five goals. He also appeared on the bench of the senior teams a couple of times. He is now a free agent after leaving the club on June 30, 2023. Dylan Maes Maes was in fine form for Slovenian second tier league team NK Tolmin in the first round of the league, playing 15 games and scoring once. The towering central defender will move from the newly promoted side in the January transfer window. He told Times Sport a few weeks ago that he is in talks with some clubs in Bulgarie. Yves Mitsindo Mitsindo has been without a club this 2023/24 season. The energetic midfielder was touted as the next biggest thing in Belgian football after captaining their national U16 team but his career hasn&#039;t gone on well due to injuries. Now 20, Mitsindo was released by KV Mechelen U21 on July 1, 2022 and he hasn&#039;t joined any team yet. Currently, he is being courted by some teams in the Belgian third tier with teams like Tienen in the fray. Mitsindo has already switched his allegiance to Rwanda and is eligible to represent the country at U23 and senior national team level.

ALSO READ: Ntwari&#039;s heroics propel TS Galaxy to Telkom second round Born on September 25, 1999, in Musanze District, northern Rwanda, Ntwari&#039;s journey began on the streets and residential areas of his hometown where he enjoyed playing soccer with friends. His love for the game later led him to the capital, Kigali, where he joined the APR FC Academy in 2015 after featuring for various youth teams in Musanze. While in Kigali, he did not find it easy to kick-on. The prospect of playing for APR\u2019s first team proved challenging as he faced limited playing time due to a number of experienced goalkeepers at the club. Playing for APR\u2019s junior team \u201cIntare FC,\u201d he kept putting in the hard work and soon, his talent began to be noticed by the national team\u2019s technical bench. Ntwari has a rare story, having been called up on the senior national team while playing in the second division. I got my first Amavubi call up in the 2017/2018 season while I was playing for Intare FC in the 2nd division. I was very happy for that call up,\u201d he says. ALSO READ: Players Abroad: Ntwari saves TS Galaxy again in Telkom cup His breakthrough at club level came in 2018 when he moved to Marines FC on a loan deal. While at the club, he got more playing time and managed to showcase his skills which earned him a move to AS Kigali. Since then, things started to change for the youngster as a few years later he would even get a deal outside of Rwanda. Saving penalties Ntwari considers saving penalties talent from God. He says he has been confident in penalty shootouts since his early days in academies and U20 teams. The unique skill has become one of his big assets. Since I was young in academies or U20 teams, I used to save penalties. Until now, I\u2019m confident when it comes to penalties,\u201d he says. As a goalkeeper, he has faced many attackers but he points out Beninese striker Steve Mounie as the best he has played against so far. Against Benin in Cotonou, I made more than five saves but he scored late and the game ended 1-1,\u201d Ntwari recalls. Talking about the best defenders he has had in front of him as a goalkeeper, he noted that the AS Kigali centre back pair of Latif Bishira and Ally Kwitonda was a reliable one.

Despite the fact that it is their first season in topflight football, the Bules are determined to challenge AS Kigali WFC who have been dominating women&#039;s football in Rwanda over the past decade. Kayitesi, a talented midfielder, was one of the standout players in AS Kigali and she is widely regarded as one of the best in the league. She and Uwimbabazi join a list of AS Kigali players who have joined the \u2018Blues\u2019 in the past 12 months. Others include Sifa Uwanyirigira, Doroth\u00e9e Mukeshimana, Joselyne Mukantaganira, Jeannette Mukeshimana, and Alice Kalimba.

The report showed that an approximate $ 2.8 billion was made available for the development of sports across the world between 2016 and 2023. With this, FIFA Forward funded over 1,600 specific projects, a third of which relate to football infrastructure. ALSO READ: Ferwafa hotel complete, ready for operations Africa has been a major beneficiary of FIFA&#039;s developmental schemes. In 2020 alone, the world football governing body rolled out eight programs to help in the development of the sport on the continent. Such programs include La Balle aux Prisonniers in Cote D&#039;Ivoire, Play Soccer Ghana, Angaza Sports and Development centre in Kenya and Futebol da For\u00e7a in Mozambique. On a specific note, Rwanda has been on the forefront of FIFA\u2019s support in the CECAFA zone. For instance, in March 2023, the government of Rwanda and FIFA launched a schools&#039; football program in Kigali, an initiative estimated to cost $ 100 million. In addition, with FIFA\u2019s support, a 42-room accommodation facility worth $4.7 million has been constructed in Kigali. It was inaugurated in March 2023 by FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. It will serve as a camping place for various national teams when they come to Rwanda. Annually, FIFA contributes up to $3.4 million to Rwanda&#039;s football for administrative and guidance, $ 2.5 million for infrastructure, and $1.6 million for the different national teams. Furthermore, $900,000 is disbursed for equipment, $800,000 for competitions, $300,000 for the development of women&#039;s football and another $300,000 for capacity development. In general, during the first seven years of FIFA Forward, the institution disbursed approximately $2.8 billion to the 211 FIFA member associations, the six confederations, and various zonal or regional associations, and funded more than 1,600 specific projects with a long-term impact on football development. \u201cWe pledged that revenues generated by football would be used for the benefit of our sport all around the world, for girls and boys, women and men, and we were as good as our word,\u201d said Infantino. \u201cInvestment in football is both our responsibility and our obligation, and through FIFA Forward we have the structure to do that in a viable and transparent way. The outcome has been a sevenfold increase in investment since 2016 \u2013 during a spell in which FIFA\u2019s revenues have not even doubled. This shows that funding is not only being delivered correctly, but it is being monitored and implemented to ensure the sustainable development of football for the long term, he added. From 2023, FIFA Forward promises to go an extra mile by delivering more improved facilities for football development. Each FIFA Member Association is eligible to receive up to $8 million per four-year cycle, with additional funding available for confederations and zonal or regional associations.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID131": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-22T14:56:20+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-22T14:56:20+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-22T14:56:19+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13295/sports/football/senegalese-striker-paul-gomis-set-to-join-rayon-sports", "headline": "Senegalese striker Paul Gomis set to join Rayon Sports", "description": "Senegalese striker Alon Paul Gomis is on the verge of joining Rwandan topflight team Rayon Sports, with his arrival in Kigali on the morning of Friday,...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13295/sports/football/senegalese-striker-paul-gomis-set-to-join-rayon-sports"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/22/37361.jpeg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/22/37361.jpeg"}, "articleBody": "Senegalese striker Alon Paul Gomis is on the verge of joining Rwandan topflight team Rayon Sports, with his arrival in Kigali on the morning of Friday, December 21 marking a significant step in the process.

My wish, in accordance to the difficult life that I am going through at Kiyovu related to my professional work, it is hard for me to play when I don&#039;t get a salary because it has been three months now without being paid. This is the reason I have asked you to terminate my contract and give me a release letter and look for another team, he added. Kiyovu\u2019s tug of war Kiyovu have been struggling to pay salaries for players during the ongoing 2023/24 season and Mugunga is among players who are unhappy with the situation. While he cited illness behind his recent absence from club training, his employers aren\u2019t convinced with his reasons as long as the club doctor was not informed about his state of health. The club also described his reasons for not reporting to training as \u2018baseless\u2019 and distanced itself from issug a bounced cheque. \u201cThe fact that you have not received your salary should be reason not to report to training because you are not the only player that the club owes the salary,\u201d the club told Mugunga in a letter dated Wednesday, December 20. Mugunga is now suspended from all club\u2019s football activities until further notice as club management examines his situation. Mugunga becomes the second player reported to have handed in a contract termination request due to unpaid salaries after skipper Olivier Niyonzima who is also linked to a move back to Rayon Sports.

Usually, most clubs prefer beefing their squads by signing players plying their trade in the domestic league as they know the terrain and need little or no time to adapt. The first transfer window of 2024 opens from January 1-31 and Times Sport takes a look at five players who could change clubs. Elia Kategeya (Mukura VS to APR FC) It is almost a done deal as Kategeya looks likely to sign for APR FC from Mukura Victory Sports in the January transfer window. A talented central midfielder, Kategeya\u2019s move has become necessary for the army side considering the fact that they do not have a recognized offensive midfielder and also their two main central midfielders Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub and Ismail Nshimirimana have been struggling with injuries which forced them out for weeks without playing. But the youngster is most importantly regarded as a backup for midfielder Claude Niyomugabo who has been playing every minute so far this campaign. ALSO READ: Kategeya hits double as Mukura beat Gasogi United in six goal thriller Christophe Bukuru( Mukura VS to Etincelles) The experienced midfielder was released by Mukura Victory Sports at the end of the 2023/24 transfer window as the two parties decided to part ways through mutual consent. Bukuru is not new to the league, having played for APR, Rayon Sports, Rutsiro and he also had two spells with Mukura Victory Sports. Before joining Mukura in July 2023, he was on the radar of Sunrise FC but the deal fell through. He is now without a club but Times Sport understands that Rubavu-based arch-rivals Etincelles or Marines FC are fighting for his signature although the former are favorites to land him as soon as the January transfer window opens. Moses Nyamurangwa to Sunrise FC The Rwanda U23 defensive midfielder was in the form of his life during the 2022/23 season to the point that he caught the attention of Police who eventually tied him down to a two-year deal during the June 2023 transfer window. He has, however, failed to break into Vincent Mashami\u2019s team and hasn&#039;t even made a single appearance in the ongoing 2023/24 season for the law enforcers who sit second in the Primus National League with 31 points, two behind league leaders APR FC. For now, a loan deal is the only option for Nyamurangwa and his former club Sunrise FC are ready to bring him back as he seeks playing time to regain his confidence. Elijah Ani (Bugesera FC to AS Kigali) There could be another transfer saga as it happened a year ago when Moro Sumaila was made to return to Etincelles after his move to AS Kigali fell through at the last minute. The Citizens are in need of a striker to support Erisa Keith Ssekisambu upfront and the club management has identified Bugesera FC forward Elijah Ani, who has scored 9 goals in the first round of the league, as their main target. The player is ready for a bigger challenge but the onus lies on the Nyamata-based club to release him if AS Kigali tables a reasonable offer. It is very dicey as Bugesera FC would want to hold on to him at least till the season ends. Fiston Nkinzingabo to leave Mukura Times Sport can confirm that talks are underway between the midfielder&#039;s agent and the top hierarchy of Mukura Victory Sports as the player wants his contract terminated. The player has found himself in a frustrating situation at the club since Lotfi Afahmia deployed him in what doesn\u2019t seem to be his preferred position: behind the striker as a number 10. He featured in just five games for the club in the first round and he is eager for a new challenge elsewhere.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID141": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-19T12:32:45+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-19T12:32:45+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-19T12:40:32+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13214/sports/football/kategeya-edges-closer-to-apr-fc-move", "headline": "Kategeya edges closer to APR FC move", "description": "Mukura Victory Sports midfielder Elia Kategeya has agreed personal terms with APR FC as his move to the army side beckons.

Some individual performances had an instrumental impact in their teams\u2019 current standings on the table led by reigning champions APR with 33 points. The army side is, however, looking their shoulders, with pressure from Police FC (31 points), Musanze (29 points) and Rayon Sports (27) looming. As the league is on a one-month festive break, Times Sport takes a look at players who made the different in their respective positions during the first round. ALSO READ: Five key highlights from the first round of the Primus National League Goalkeeper: Pavelh Ndzila (APR) The Congolese shot stopper was not convincing for APR in the CAF Champions League campaign in which they were handed a premature elimination by Pyramids FC but he has been superb on the domestic front. Ndzila conceded just nine goals in 15 league matches, the least so far this season. He single-handedly saved APR against Mukura in which he pulled as many as five point blank saves. RB: Cedric Kubwimana (Mukura VS) The enterprising right back had in rich vein of form, scoring four goals and providing two assists despite playing in defense. A marauding lateral defender, Kubwimana contributes immensely to both defensive and attacking duties. He has been a key element for his club. LB: Christian Ishimwe (APR) Ishimwe missed some games as sometimes coach Thierry Froger tried to rotate him with Claude Niyomugabo. However, he has made his contributions noticed whenever he was on duty at the left side of APR FC defense. CB: Isaac Mitima (Rayon Sports) The towering central defender has a great command at the back and has always been efficient. With skipper Abdul Rwatubyaye still trying to find his best form, Mitima has been the main man at the back for Rayon Sports. He excelled greatly in games against Gasogi, Mukura, and Police FC. CB: Clement Niyigena (APR FC) Niyigena might not have played a lot of games for APR this season but anytime he is on the field, he brings stability to the APR back four. He has paired Prince Buregeya, Yunus Nshimiyimana as well as Salomon Bindjeme and has excelled greatly. DM: Joseph Sackey (Muhazi United) Sackey has been dominant for Muhazi United putting up superb performances against Gorilla FC, Sunrise and APR. He has two goals and two assists to his name so far this season which is commendable for a holding midfielder. CM: Abdul Rahman Rukundo (Amagaju FC) Rukundo has been the heart and soul of newly promoted Amagaju with some breathtaking displays. Rukundo has netted 7 goals from the midfield in 15 games, and he has been efficient for the club. He is the reason why they are occupying a mid-table position. Left Wing: Heritier Luvumbu ( Rayon Sports) Luvumbu could operate either behind a striker or on the left wing depending on Mohamed Wade\u2019s formation of play. The Congo international has scored six goals for the Blues this season and has been their key man. Once Luvumbu has his day, expect Rayon to win. His most outstanding moment was on October 21 when he bagged a hat-trick against Sunrise FC. Right wing: Muhadjiri Hakizimana (Police FC) Hakizimana did not start the season well after Police blocked his $70,000-a-year move to Iraq. At one point, he was even suspended from the team for poor output and attitude after defeat to APR. The experienced midfielder was, however, able to put all behind him and he has now become the live wire of Police FC. He has 8 league goals to his name so far this campaign and has been exceptional for the club. Attack: Peter Agblevor (Musanze FC) Agblevor has scored 10 league goals in his last 12 league appearances this season. Musanze FC has been depending on the Ghanaian and they, at the same time, struggled in his absence especially when he was handed a three match suspension games after he was suspended for a horror challenge of AS Kigali goalkeeper Yves Kimenyi. ALSO READ: Hit or Miss? How have new signings fared Centre forward: Victor Mbaoma (APR FC) The Nigerian striker has been a revelation for defending Champions APR in the first round of the league. Mbaoma has scored 12 league goals, and his goals were crucial to the team\u2019s table topping in the forts round. The most notable one was his last gasp goal against Mukura in the 94th minute on October 13. Mbaoma is a Fox in the box and he can get the job done at any time.

Copenhagen, who earned a memorable win against Manchester United on their way to finishing second in Group A, are the lowest-ranked side left in the competition. Elsewhere, Barcelona were drawn to face Napoli, notable for being two former clubs of late Argentina legend Diego Maradona. United States stars Ricardo Pepi and Sergino Dest will face international teammate Giovanni Reyna with Borussia Dortmund and PSV Eindhoven drawn against each other. Arsenal, in their first appearance in the round of 16 since 2016-17, face two-time winners FC Porto, while Bayern Munich were matched up with Lazio. Paris Saint-Germain, who finished runners-up in Group F behind Borussia Dortmund, drew Spanish side Real Sociedad. Madrid&#039;s clash with Leipzig comes as they were dealt another major injury blow, as defender David Alaba tore an ACL in their 4-1 LaLiga win over Villarreal on Sunday. Club director of institutional relations Emilio Butrague\u00f1o said Madrid are unsure whether they will replace the defender in the upcoming January transfer window. As Carlo [Ancelotti] said, we&#039;ll see in the next few days what we decide [to do]. The team has showed it&#039;s capable of facing any challenge. We&#039;ll wait over the next few days and see what we do, he said. We&#039;re facing a difficult situation; it&#039;s surprising to have so many injuries, and serious ones. [Thibaut] Courtois, [Eder] Milit\u00e3o and Alaba will be out now. Despite that, we&#039;re in a fantastic moment. But obviously the injury to Alaba is a setback; we&#039;ll have to work together to overcome it. The round of 16 kicks off with group winners hosting the first-leg matches, which will be played Feb. 13, 14, 20 and 21. Return legs will be played on March 5, 6, 12 and 13.

This was the introduction of a story published in The New Times of Wednesday, December 13. If this line popped up on your phone screen as a notification and somehow, you don&#039;t read the rest of the story, you may be tempted to assume the player must have done something out of the ordinary to warrant his actions as assault. Fair enough, the photo looks somewhat provocative to the eye but, if you are a sports person, you find that players normally have/get physical contact with match officials--it&#039;s not encouraged or allowed but it&#039;s normal! In the world of sports, controversies often arise, and football is no stranger to heated moments that spark debates and discussions. Akayezu finds himself in the midst of a storm after that eye-catching photo circulated on social media, capturing a moment that led to allegations of (sexual) assault against referee Umutoni. Despite the noise surrounding the incident, the Rwanda Football Association (FERWAFA) and Umutoni demonstrated commendable judgment in not pursuing charges against Akayezu. First and foremost, it is crucial to acknowledge the match official&#039;s role in maintaining the integrity of the game. Referee Umutoni, entrusted with upholding the laws of football, exhibited a high level of professionalism by not allowing external pressure to influence her decision-making. In situations where players may attempt to dispute a call, referees must remain resolute and focused on the rules of the game. Umutoni&#039;s silence on the alleged incident in her match report speaks volumes about her commitment to fair play and the principle of not letting external factors interfere with her duties. What&#039;s more, the absence of any mention of the incident in Umutoni&#039;s match report underscores her confidence in handling the situation appropriately during the game. Umutoni knows what she signed for, and Indeed she stayed steadfast in her ability to handle a man&#039;s game. Referees are trained to identify and report any misconduct or violations accurately, and Umutoni&#039;s omission of the alleged assault on her, in her report, suggests that she did not perceive it as a significant breach of the rules. This aligns with the notion that referees are entrusted to make real-time judgments on the field, and their reports serve as a comprehensive account of the match&#039;s events. FERWAFA&#039;s decision to not pursue charges against Akayezu further reinforces the importance of a measured assessment of incidents that occur during matches. While public opinion may vary, the football governing body must adhere to a fair and consistent disciplinary process. In this case, the absence of a formal complaint from the referee, combined with the lack of a clear breach of the rules, led FERWAFA to rightly prioritize maintaining the integrity of the sport over succumbing to external pressures. It&#039;s crucial to recognize that not every on-field incident requires legal intervention. Referees have the authority to manage and control matches, and their decisions are final within the context of the game. In situations where players may engage in heated exchanges or attempts to influence officials, the football community and general public should trust the expertise of the referees and the game&#039;s governing body to handle matters appropriately. Referee Umutoni and FERWAFA&#039;s decision not to pursue charges against Akayezu reflects a commitment to the principles of fair play and adherence to the rules of the game. Their actions demonstrate a dedication to maintaining the integrity of football by allowing the on-field officials to exercise their judgment without unnecessary external interference. Long may this firmness continue. So, when feminists like Sylvie Nsanga claim that the player assaulted Umutoni and goes ahead to call on Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) to pick interest in the incident, I wonder, if that would not be stretching the boundaries of the laws of the game. According to The New Times\u2019 article, Nsanga suggests that a gender mainstreaming strategy involving human rights and women&#039;s rights organisations should be prioritized to ensure safety and protection of women in sports. \u201cYou have to put strong mechanisms to detect sexual harassment and prevent it,\u201d she posted on her X account. While I respect her opinion and support her proposal, my view is that controversies will always be a part of football, and it is essential to appreciate and support decisions that prioritize the sport&#039;s core values and the authority of those responsible for upholding them, otherwise, we risk having on-field decisions being taken in boardrooms. That will be the end of football!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hamza Nkuutu"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID148": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-15T14:14:20+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-15T14:14:20+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-16T09:14:54+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13122/sports/football/mukansanga-becomes-first-rwandan-video-assistant-referee", "headline": "Mukansanga becomes first Rwandan Video Assistant Referee", "description": "Referee Salma Mukansanga, a listed international referee for FIFA since 2012, has become the first Rwandan Video Assistant Referee (VAR).

During his first day in Rwanda, Timber visited the Genocide Memorial Centre and paid respects to the victims of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.

It was an action-packed display, characterised by stunning goals, fiercely contested matches, outstanding individual performances, and, notably, a high turnout of spectators at various stadiums. Here are key takeaways from the first fifteen games of the season: 1. Six coaches fired Clubs wasted no time to dismiss underperforming coaches. In just four months, six coaches were let go: Yamen Zelfani of Rayon Sports, Eric Nshimiyimana of Bugesera, Maurice Nshimiyimana of Etoile, Hassan Muhire of Sunrise FC, Andre Casa Mbungo of AS Kigali, and Petros Koukuras of Kiyovu Sports. ALSO READ: Nshimiyimana sacked as Bugesera FC head coach For teams like Sunrise FC and AS Kigali, such moves played out well, as they climbed out of the drop zone. 2. Race for the golden boot intensifies The competition for the top scorer award in the 2023/24 season has heated up, with three players firmly in the race. Victor Mbaoma of APR FC leads with 12 goals in 15 games, followed by Peter Agblevor with 10 goals in 11 games, and Muhadjiri Hakizimana of Police and Elijah Ani of Bugesera with 9 goals each. These players, vital to their teams, are expected to continue their goal-scoring spree in the second round, and may surpass Leandre Onana&#039;s 15 goals that secured the award in the 2022/23 season. 3. APR&#039;s unbeaten streak In the 15 games, APR FC demonstrated dominance by winning 9 and drawing 6 without any defeats. Though the team\u2019s display has not been convincing in some games, especially during the goalless derby against Gasogi where coach Thierry Froger faced criticism from fans, the army side\u2019s unbeaten record is such a big feat. 4. Musanze&#039;s resurgence Historically a mid-table team, Musanze FC emerged as a potential title contender in the so far. The team was in third position by the time the first round closed.

Alongside his girlfriend, the Dutch international landed at Kigali International Airport on Thursday, December 14 to start his three-day visit which will involve various activities including meeting and interacting with youngsters. The trip is part of Visit Rwanda\u2019s multi-year partnership with Arsenal FC. It is an amazing experience. Lots of people can say the same, I was excited to come. And even as I am here, I am more excited to be honest, he said during a media interview he had at the airport. This is Timber\u2019s first visit to the African continent. He will experience Rwanda\u2019s remarkable hospitality and culture, travel to Akagera National Park to enjoy a Big 5 safari, interact with Arsenal fans in Kigali and Nyagatare, as well as visiting the Kigali Genocide Memorial to pay respects to the victims and to learn more about the Genocide against the Tutsi. The 22-year old defender is the second Arsenal men\u2019s first team player to visit the country since the partnership\u2019s launch, following in the footsteps of former Arsenal defender David Luiz who visited Rwanda in 2019. \u201cMy expectation is to have a nice time. We have a full program, so I am going to enjoy the time. My girlfriend came with me. I think we can have a good time,\u201d he noted. Over the years, Arsenal legends Edu Gaspar, Robert Pires, Alex Scott, Tony Adams, Lauren, Ray Parlour, David Seaman, Sol Campbell, and women first team players Caitlin Foord, Jordan Nobbs, Jen Beatie, and Katie McCabe have visited Rwanda. Timber, a central defender cum right back joined Arsenal from Ajax during the summer transfer window, but has made just one appearance for the team due to injury. He says he is getting better and closer to fitness. I am feeling good. It (recovery from injury) is a long process. A lot of hard work! I can&#039;t complain about how it is going now,\u201d he said. Francis Gatare, Chief Executive Officer, Rwanda Development Board, welcomed Timber to Rwanda, promising that he will have a great time in the \u201cvibrancy and beauty\u201d of the country. \u201cJurri\u00ebn\u2019s visit in Rwanda avails an opportunity to showcase to the World our country\u2019s energy, creativity and transformation. We also guarantee him a one-of-a-kind experience with some of our most talented young footballers who aspire to play at his level one day and represent Rwanda on a global stage,\u201d Gatare said. Visit Rwanda\u2019s partnership with Arsenal, as the club\u2019s inaugural Sleeve Sponsor and Official Tourism Partner has been highly successful in making Rwanda a must-see holiday destination for football fans and tourists around the world. An independent survey conducted by Hall and Partners of Arsenal fans across 30 markets found that 75 percent of Arsenal fans were not aware of Rwanda as a tourism destination, and, as a result of the partnership, 51 percent of fans are now more likely to consider Rwanda as a tourist destination, demonstrating a shift in perception and understanding of the country. In 2022, 1.1 million people visited Rwanda with the country earning over US$ 445 million in revenues.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID152": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-14T00:04:43+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-14T00:04:43+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-14T15:41:03+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13075/sports/football/hit-or-miss-how-have-new-signings-fared", "headline": "Hit or Miss: How have new signings fared?", "description": "The July-August transfer market could be ranked among the busiest transfer windows that Rwandan football has witnessed in years.

Each of the 16 topflight clubs were active on the market with a host of mega signings as they aimed to beef up their squads. It has been a rollercoaster since the 2023/24 Primus National League started on August 23 with some of the players already living up to expectations while others are struggling to impress despite big money moves. As the first round of the league winds up, Times Sport takes a look at standout players and flops among new signings. Hits Victor Mbaoma (APR FC) APR signed Mbaoma as a free agent in July after the striker left Uzbekistan side Qizilgun Zarafshon. Despite struggling at the CAF Champions League, he has been in fine form, scoring 12 league goals in 15 games. APR has over the years struggled for a formidable goal scorer and Mbaoma seems to be their ultimate answer to their woes. Mbaoma has been scoring for fun and, should he continue where he stopped in the first round, the Nigerian is undoubtedly destined to finish as the league top scorer. Elijah Ani (Bugesera FC) Bugesera FC are struggling in the Primus National League but Ani has been on fire. The Nigerian striker has banged in 9 league goals for the relegation-threatened team, including superb strikes against Kiyovu Sports and Police FC. Haringingo will be counting on the forward\u2019s goals as he looks to rescue the Nyamata-based club from the relegation. Joseph Sackey (Muhazi United) It virtually looks like the biggest transfer bargain that Muhazi United has made. The Ghanaian defensive midfielder has been their best player in the first round of the season. Signed from Ghanaian second tier side Wa Suntaa FC where he won the player of the season during in 2023, Sackey has continued his excellent form in the Rwandan Primus National League. In 15 games, he scored two goals and provided two assists. Not so bad for a defensive midfielder. ALSO READ: Sackey predicts tough game against Rayon sports Richard Kilongozi (Kiyovu) The Burundian winger has exhibited fantastic output for a Kiyovu Sports team whose form has been patchy due to internal administrative disorders. Kilongozi has has been at the heart of the Mumena-based side\u2019s redemption and his influence in big games has been key for the club. He has bagged six goals and provided a couple of assists so far this season. Arguably one of the most feared forwards in the league. Abedi Bigirimana (Police FC) The Burundi international started the season on a poor note as he looked bulky and out of form considering that he was settling for new life at Police FC. He, however, was able to quickly rediscover his form with the assistance of Vincent Mashami and his technical team. ALSO READ: Transfer updates: Kimenyi joins AS Kigali as Bigirimana agrees Police move The 2021/22 Primus National League player of the season has scored seven goals so far this season despite and, with Muhadjiri Hakizimana by his side, they have carried Police FC to second place on the table with 31 points, just two shy of leaders APR FC. With the midfield duo, Police FC have established themselves among APR\u2019s big threat to the league title. Misses Moses Nyamurangwa (Police FC) Nyamurangwa moved to Police FC in July after excelling for Sunrise FC in the 2022/23 season. The youngster has failed to stake a claim in the Police FC team as he continues to struggle for game time in the club\u2019s pecking order considering that he has not made a single appearance for the club. If Nyamurangwa does not up his work rate and break into Mashami\u2019s team at all cost, he could be offloaded in June. Moro Sumaila (Police FC) The Ghanaian striker was a hit at Etincelles last season scoring ten goals in the first round of the 2022/23 season. He had to force a move to Police FC months after his transfer to AS Kigali in January fell through. Moro did not have a preseason with his new club as he completed his move after four rounds of games in the league and, by that time, the squad was intact. The Ghanaian has played only cameo roles at Police FC this season, always coming on as a late substitute. He scored just once in the first round of the season. Mikel Freeman (Kiyovu SC) The Liberian striker was in fine form for Oilers in his home country scoring for fun before joining Kiyovu in July. He has failed to cement a place in the team losing his position to Richard Kilongozi, the club\u2019s current main man. The 1.94m forward could be released in June if he doesn&#039;t improve. Youssef Rharb (Rayon Sports) Now having his second spell at Rayon Sports, a lot was expected from the Moroccan attacker as the club hope he would play an instrumental role in their CAF Confederation Cup campaign. READ ALSO: Youssef Rharb set for shock Rayon return However, he has been a pale shadow of himself. Youssef\u2019s poor disciplinary record still haunts him as he was banished from the first team only for him to be brought back when he turned a new leaf. ALSO READ: Rayon Sports make U-turn on Youssef\u2019s future Few, or none, doubt the forward\u2019s talent but he is at the same time proving to be a wasted talent. Time to recover his form before the second round comes or he will be released. Danny Ndikumana (APR FC) APR FC thought they signed the next biggest football hopeful in Ndikumana but the former Rukinzo FC prodigy has failed to glitter. He is now a forgotten man, having failed to even make the cut in Thierry Froger\u2019s bench. Ndikumana has not made a single appearance for the army side this season and the club could consider loaning him so he could get playing time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID153": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-13T14:23:41+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-13T14:23:41+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-13T14:23:40+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13066/sports/football/seninga-insists-no-team-is-making-the-difference-in-the-league", "headline": "Seninga insists no team is making the difference in the league", "description": "Former Sunrise FC coach Innocent Seninga claims the level of the teams in the Primus National League is almost the same as not a single side proved to be...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13066/sports/football/seninga-insists-no-team-is-making-the-difference-in-the-league"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/13/36576.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/13/36576.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Former Sunrise FC coach Innocent Seninga claims the level of the teams in the Primus National League is almost the same as not a single side proved to be unstoppable over the course the first round.

Akayezu has been at the centre of controversy since a photo of him apparently touching Umutoni\u2019s chest went viral as he tried to convince the referee not to show him a second yellow card for a bookable offense over winger Arsene Tuyisenge in the 76th minute of the match during which his side beat Rayon Sports 2-1 at Kigali Pele Stadium on Saturday, December 9. READ ALSO: Ten-man AS Kigali shock Rayon Sports The photo sparked divided opinions in the public with some describing it as an attempt to assault the referee while others suggested that the player was involved in an \u2018accidental physical contact\u2019 with her in an apparent attempt to avoid being sent off. From her observation, feminist Sylvie Nsanga claimed that the player assaulted Umutoni before calling on Rwanda Investigation Bureau to pick interest in the incident.

However, Akayezu strongly dismissed alleged assault claims as opposed to allegations from the public. The defender told Times Sport that, \u201cI never meant to disrespect or insult the referee during the incident. My only intention was to plead for forgiveness and avoid a red card.\u201d \u201cI deeply regret what happened, but it was never my intention (sexual assault). I respect the game and the match officials,\u201d he added. FA reacts While the photo made rounds and sparked divided opinions, local football governing body (FERWAFA) investigated the matter based on the referee\u2019s report after the match before contacting her for further verification. \u201cWe looked into the referee&#039;s report and she never mentioned that she was subject to any form of assault. I also spoke to the her for further clarification and she said that the player didn&#039;t touch her,\u201d FERWAFA spokesperson Jules Karangwa told Times Sport. Karangwa said that the FA will not any further action against Akayezu other than maintaining his one-match suspension after he was sent off for a second bookable offense during AS Kigali\u2019s match against Rayon Sports. The suspension, as a result, saw him miss club\u2019s goalless draw against Muhazi United at Ngoma Stadium on Tuesday, December 12.

Heritier Luvumbu could even have snatched an injury time winner for Blues only to miss a sitter in the 95th minute to the relief the Mumena-based side. Coach Muhamed Wade used a 4-3-3 formation against the Green Baggies with Eric Ngendahimana being paired with Abdul Rwatubyaye in the heart of defence while Roger Kanamugire joined Kevin Muhire and Heritier Luvumbu in midfield, replacing Rashid Kalisa who was serving a one-match suspension. Kiyovu, on the other hand, opted for a 4-2-3-1 formation with Fred Muhozi behind lone ranger Richard Kilongozi. It was a nervy start for both teams but Kiyovu calmed the tempo as they took control of the game in early stages. Kiyovu right back and former Rayon star Karim Nizigiyimana overlapped on the right and delivered a cut back cross to Shariff Bayo who hit a ferocious drive outside the box to fire the visitors ahead in the 12th minute. The goal awoke the Blues as they quickly regrouped to dominate the game pushing for an equalizer. They started most of their attack from the back where skipper Abdul Rwatubyaye was superb. ALSO READ: Rayon Sports host Kiyovu in dicey derby Rayon had the chance to even the scores in the 18th minute but Musa Esenu fluffed his effort wide from the right side of Kiyovu\u2019s vital area. Muhire, who was pulling the strings in the midfield, was brought down at the edge of the Kiyovu penalty box but the resultant free kick was agonizingly wasted by Heritier Luvumbu in the 30th minute. Kiyovu were very tactical as they soaked the pressure and occasionally broke loose on counter attacks as they made some vital incursions but Rayon\u2019s back four curtailed the danger. With five minutes to end the first half, Ali Serumogo moved forward and used Muhire as a decoy before hitting a short which missed the target to the relief of Kiyovu goalkeeper Djihad Nzeyurwanda. The first half ended with Kiyovu leading 1-0 though Rayon had been a dominant force in terms of ball possession. The second half begun with Rayon in control as they pinned Kiyovu into their own half. The Blues tried to utilize the pace of Ojera to great effects as they often released the balls to him to cut in. But the Ugandan forward looked far from impressive on the evening as he struggled to make the best of the chances at his disposal. Rayon\u2019s attackers posed major threats in Kiyovu\u2019s penalty box on numerous occasions but Eric Ndizeye and Felicien Hakizimana had formed a defensive wall that was too tough to break. With two minutes to end the game, Ngendahimana, who had a fantastic game, popped up with the equalizer in the 88th minute to deny a win for Kiyovu SC. Kiyovu suffered in the stoppage time as they tried to defend at least a point against a Rayon side which wanted nothing but a win to close the gap to four points between them and league leaders APR FC. And the fans thought Luvumbu was going to win it late for the Blues before failing to tap in Ojera\u2019s cross in the last minute. There was not much chances in injury time as the referee blew his whistle for the end of the game. Other games Police FC made mince meat of Musanze FC as they thrashed them 3-0. In form Muhadjiri Hakizimana netted a brace with Abedi Bigirimana adding another as the law enforcer finished the first round of the league in the second place with 31 points. In Nyamata, Bugesera FC defeated equally struggling Etoile de l\u2019Est 2-0 with Placide Rwabuhihi and Elijah Ani being the goal scorers.

This is going to be the 16th meeting between the two teams since 2016 with Rayon having the upper hand with seven wins, three draws and five defeats. Kiyovu, now sixth on the league table with 20 points after 14 games, have been patchy this season while Rayon have been in fine form before falling to a 2-1 loss to AS Kigali on December 9. They now sit third with 26 points. Form does not count in local derbies and Rayon themselves can attest to it after surprise loss at the hands of the \u2018Citizens\u2019 who were deep in the relegation zone. It is going to be an intriguing game with much at stake. During the 2022/23 season, Rayon failed to beat Kiyovu both home and away in the league as the Green Baggies picked four points out of six. The Blues will be hoping to write a new script as they face another litmus test. In terms of player quality, Kiyovu will rely on Burundian striker Richard Kilongozi who has scored in each of his last three games for the club while skipper Olivier Niyonzima will be looking to show what his former side has been missing from him since he left the club IN 2019. Rayon will also count on Joackiam Ojera and the evergreen Heritier Luvumbu who has been arguably the best midfielder in the Primus National League so far this season. If both players have a good day, expect the Blues to flourish. Other Games Musanze vs Police Musanze FC will lock horns with Police FC at Kigali Pele Stadium in a mouth-watering clash. The pair are separated with one point with Musanze FC sitting second with 29 points whereas Police FC are third with 28 points. The game promises to be exciting and it will be a tale of the attack of two teams. Striker Peter Agblevor has scored 10 goals so far in the league and has netted twice in two games since returning from a three-match suspension.

We are well poised for the game. Our mission is to amass all three points and finish second in the first round as we continue to chase APR, Agblevor told Times Sport. Police FC is a strong team, they are our rivals and so are title contenders. We hope to go all out and beat them. Police will rely on offensive midfielder Muhadjiri Hakizimana who has been in top form since Frank Spittler snubbed him in his national team squad that played the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Zimbabwe and South Africa. Bugesera vs Etoile de l&#039;Est Two relegation threatened teams will sort it out in Nyamata when Bugesera FC entertain Etoile de l&#039;Est. Both teams desperately need the three maximum points.

Osimhen, who led Napoli to win the Italian League title last season, beat Paris Saint-Germain&#039;s Morocco right-back, Achraf Hakimi and Liverpool&#039;s Egypt winger, Mohamed Salah, to win the top award. It&#039;s a dream come true for me, Osimhen said. I appreciate Nigerians for their support. I appreciate Africa for putting me on the map, encouraging me, and defending me, regardless of my shortcomings, the 24-year-old added. Osimhen excelled last season for Napoli, after scoring 31 goals in all competitions and contributing to them winning the Italian League title after a drought that lasted 33 years. Napoli estimate Osimhen&#039;s market value at approximately \u20ac200 million. Osimhen was spotted by European scouts at the 2015 edition of the under-17 World Cup in Chile and joined German outfit Wolfsburg. He was loaned to Charleroi and later joined the Belgian club permanently. His next move was to French side Lille in 2019, where he scored 13 goals in 27 appearances. Napoli signed him one year later for \u20ac70 million, but he contracted Covid-19 during a visit to Nigeria and later suffered a head injury and a fractured skull and eye socket. Those injuries led Osimhen to wear a protective mask and sections of the media called him the masked assassin. He missed the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon due to the injuries, and Nigeria suffered a shock last-16 loss to Tunisia. INJURY PRONE Osimhen was the leading scorer with 10 goals in qualifying for the 2024 Cup of Nations, which the Ivory Coast will host from January 13. His total included four in a 10-0 rout of Sao Tome e Principe -- a record winning margin for a qualifier in the competition. Injury-prone Osimhen was sidelined again two months ago after suffering a hamstring injury in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia. The regular absences of the Nigerian angered Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis, who reacted by saying he would sign no more Africans unless they agreed to skip the Cup of Nations. Morocco last year became the first African and Arab country to reach the World Cup semifinals and goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, his teammates and coach Walid Regragui were honoured in Marrakesh. Bounou was named goalkeeper of the year, Regragui coach of the year and Morocco the national team of the year. Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala completed a Nigerian double by winning the African Women&#039;s player of the year for a record-extending sixth time. Born in Ikorodu, north-east of commercial capital Lagos, her previous successes came in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022. After playing for Nigerian clubs Robo and Rivers Angels, she had spells with Liverpool, Arsenal and Dalian Quanjian before an initial loan move to Barcelona became permanent four years ago. Oshoala scored in a win over co-hosts Australia that helped Nigeria reach the 2023 Women&#039;s World Cup round of 16, where they lost to England on penalties.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Agencies"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID159": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-12T00:32:48+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-12T00:32:48+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-12T08:14:21+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13026/sports/football/pnl-five-talking-points-from-goal-galore-weekend-action", "headline": "PNL: Five talking points from goal galore weekend action", "description": "It was goals galore in week 14 of the Primus National League as a total of 25 goals were scored across the league centres.

APR, Police and Mukura Victory Sports were the only clubs who won away from home while five players namely Victor Mbaoma, Erisa Ssekisambu, Samson Babua, Solomon Adeyinka and Elie Kategeya all scored doubles as each of their repective teams emerged victorious. Times Sport takes a look at five things we learnt from the week 14 games. Mukura deadly wingers proving vital Mukura Victory Sports\u2019 forward line has been deadly especially from their wingers. The Huye-based thrashed Kiyovu 4-1 on December 6 before traveling to Kigali to beat Gasogi United 4-2 on Saturday, December 9. The impeccable form of the Yellow and Blacks is largely down to their flamboyant wingers where in their last two games, Elie Tatou, Samuel Pimpong and Zuber Hakizimana have made six goals contributions. They have scored three and also assisted three goals. The trio do not start games together but either of them makes their mark when he comes on. ALSO READ: Kategeya hits double as Mukura beat Gasogi United in six-goal thriller Babuwa leading Sunrise survival Sunrise has been struggling since the start of the season but now their top marksman has come to the rescue recently. Babuwa hadn&#039;t played for some time but, once he got back to the field, he was on fire. He was on target during cluib\u2019s 2-1 win over Gorilla before adding a brace on Friday, December 8 as Sunrise beat Amagaju 2-1, going on to lift the team out of the drop zone. ALSO READ: In form Babuwa insists he is proving critics wrong Froger bounces back after fans booing Thierry Froger and his men were booed by the fans after they were held to a goalless draw by Gasogi United. The French gaffer reiterated that he understands the fans\u2019 frustration but vowed to improve in the next games. He responded the critics with an emphatic 4-1 win over Gorilla FC on Friday, December 8 at Kigali Pele Stadium. The defending champions need to be consistent and churn out such results every week as Musanze FC and others are on their heels. They were again unstoppable when they traveled to Huye Stadium to beat Amagaju FC 2-1 on Monday, December 11. Etoile de l&#039;Est going from bad to worse Etoile looked not prepared for the topflight league. They recently appointed Nigeria&#039;s Amapakabo Kwaku as their new head coach after sacking Maurice Nshimiyimana. However, the Eastern Province-based club looks far from improved. Their woes continued when they were thrashed 3-0 by Police FC at Ngoma Stadium on Saturday. Etoile last won a league game on November 5 when they beat Gasogi 1-0. It is early days and there are still 16 more games to play but if Etoile don&#039;t lift up their game in the second round of the league and get some good results, they would be relegated. Ssekisambu shows quality against Rayon AS Kigali have had a poor season in the league but their redemption could be on the horizons following Saturday\u2019s 2-1 victory over Rayon Sports despite playing with a man down during the last 13 minutes of the match. Striker Erisa Ssekisambu\u2019s performance was top notch. The Ugandan forward was lively as he completely mesmerized the Rayon Sports defenders. He proved to be the live wire of AS Kigali against one of their biggest rivals.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID160": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-11T19:23:08+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-11T19:23:08+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-11T20:01:07+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13015/sports/football/mbaoma-scores-brace-again-as-ruthless-apr-dismantle-amagaju-fc", "headline": "Mbaoma scores brace again as ruthless APR dismantle Amagaju FC", "description": "Red hot striker Victor Mbaoma continued his goalscoring form as his double inspired APR FC to a 3-1 victory over Amagaju FC at Huye Stadium on Monday,...", "keywords": "", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/13015/sports/football/mbaoma-scores-brace-again-as-ruthless-apr-dismantle-amagaju-fc"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/11/36409.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/11/36409.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Red hot striker Victor Mbaoma continued his goalscoring form as his double inspired APR FC to a 3-1 victory over Amagaju FC at Huye Stadium on Monday, December 11. The defending champions outplayed and convincingly beat the newly-promoted side to finish the first round at the top of the Primus National League table standings. Both teams started the encounter brightly but APR looked more aggressive as they pinned Amagaju into their own half. Thierry Froger\u2019s high pressing approach paid off in the 16th minute when Jean Claude Dusabe bundled the ball into his own net to give the visitor&#039;s a deserved lead. APR continued to pile more pressure on Amagaju FC the and extended their lead in the 25th minute through a fantastic finish from striker Victor Mbaoma.

APR were leading 3-0 at the break leaving a mount for Amagaju climb in the second half. The home side started to create some decent chances as they made inroads into the vital area of the army side and they eventually reduced the deficit in the 52nd minute through Seth Nkurunziza. Froger brought on Innocent Nshuti and Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub for Prince Buregeya and Alain Kwitonda respectively as they pushed for the fourth goal but Amagaju\u2019s back four, led by Janvier Dushimirimana, stood resolute at the back as the game ended 3-1 in favor of APR.

The result left the defending champions at the top of the table with 27 points, nonetheless. In the same breath, the draw gave their rivals a glimmer of hope, whether false or real, in the race for the league title, but at the end of the day, the army side, so more often than not, just seems to have so much in their armoury to fight their way to the league victory, always. ALSO READ: PHOTOS: Underfire Froger booed as Gasogi United hold APR FC Rayon Sports will always be in the picture, and they are APR&#039;s main threat, unfortunately, just a threat is what they have been so frustratingly frequently for their liking. APR have been so dominant, having been crowned league champions 21 times in 28 seasons, including the last four on the trot. Such has been the club&#039;s dominance. Their rivals can&#039;t seem to have anything to do about it. Rival fans will definitely have, on their minds, other reasons, perceived or otherwise, as to why their teams are so ridiculously dominated, but from a neutral standpoint, APR&#039;s domination of Rwandan football is a testament to their formidable combination of financial backing, rich pedigree and consistent success on the pitch. However, it&#039;s very unfortunate that APR&#039;s dominance on the local scene doesn&#039;t transcend Rwandan boarders. This has been the club&#039;s biggest Achilles heel, and if performances and results don&#039;t improve in CAF competitions, then APR stands to be forever remembered, as the old proverb goes, &#039;the one-eyed man&#039; being the king! History has a way of judging so harshly. Of course, there are a number of factors that contribute to APR&#039;s consistent struggles in CAF competitions but for me, the main one is the limited exposure to higher-caliber teams in the domestic league--this, believe it or not, hinders their ability to compete at the continental level. On the home front though, the recent surprise goalless draw against Gasogi United might have raised eyebrows, leading to fans booing their coach, Thierry Froger, but it is crucial to delve into the broader context of APR&#039;s historical performance, and current strengths to understand why they are likely to maintain their stronghold on the Primus National League. ALSO READ: Froger on APR fans boos: I understand their frustrations Established in 1994, APR FC has been a powerhouse in Rwandan football ever since, winning the league title 21 times since the club made its league debut in 1995. This remarkable record underscores their unparalleled success and consistent dominance over more than two decades. One key factor contributing to their sustained excellence is the financial backing that the club enjoys. With the resources to attract top talent, better training conditions and renumerations, and secure the services of capable coaches, APR stands head and shoulders above all of its domestic rivals. The financial muscle of the club enables them to assemble squad after squad comprising some of the best players in Rwandan football, and very often, beyond. The ability to recruit and retain top talent ensures a consistent level of performance throughout the league season. Furthermore, pedigree plays a pivotal role in the dominance of APR FC. The club&#039;s rich history in national football and consistency of success, create a winning culture that spreads throughout. They may have their limits, especially on the continent but back home, their firm grip on proceedings is as tight as anything. Because they are paid well and timely, taken care of rather more professionally by the club, APR players, coaches, and staff are instilled with a sense of pride and responsibility to uphold the legacy of the club. This ingrained winning mentality becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as each individual associated with the club strives for excellence, contributing to the club&#039;s overall dominance. You can&#039;t say the same for either Rayon Sports or any other club. On the tactical front, APR FC boasts a well-structured and expensively assembled squad, that for a man, their players are a cut above the rest in the league, which is why the draw against Gasogi, though unexpected, is just a minor blip in a season-long journey. APR will overcome such hurdles and maintain their dominance. Rayon Sports, as is with every season, emerges as the main threat to APR&#039;s dominance. The rivalry between these two powerhouses adds an extra layer of intrigue to the Rwandan league. However, APR&#039;s financial prowess, combined with their historical success, provides them with a psychological edge over their rivals. The ability to navigate high-stakes encounters in a calm and composed manner is a hallmark of champions, and as history shows, APR&#039;s pedigree often shines through in crucial moments.

Fans booed the French tactician to express their disappointment at club\u2019s unimpressive output after goalless draw against Gasogi United at Kigali Pele Stadium on Wednesday. Froger said the fans were right to boo him and admits his side should work harder to improve their performance in the next matches. I think they (players) did what they had to do. We could have done better but, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t. I understand the fans\u2019 disappointment but you can\u2019t win every match. We will make sure that we win the next match, Froger said in a post match press conference In front of us, there were warriors who wanted to beat us. It&#039;s normal, we are at the top of the table standings. We defeated everyone. That&#039;s how the league is and we have to accept it and find solutions. ALSO READ: Photos: Underfire Froger booed as Gasogi United hold APR FC No pressure APR have managed just one a win their last three league games, raising concerns among fans who are already calling on the club\u2019s hierarchy to sack him. But Froger insists that he doesn&#039;t feel any pressure from the current situation as long as his team still leads the race for the title. Instead, he still believes he can get things back on the right track to avoid dropping more points. I don\u2019t feel any pressure at all. We are in good working condition,\u201d he said. We missed a lot of chances in the first half (against Gasogi United), that was really unfortunate, we had to put in more intensity. We came back in the second half, we rectified but we weren&#039;t fair enough and it gave us this little point of success. We have the opportunities, but now we have to make them happen through the right technical gestures and will. We need to change things because it\u2019s true that in terms of results it\u2019s insufficient, he added. Fallout with Shaiboub Sudanese midfielder Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub is among players who signed for APR in July after club made a U-turn on their decade-long \u2018homegrown players only\u2019 policy in December 2022. However, he has been frozen out by the coach after the pair reportedly had a fallout, prompting the tactician to drop him out of his starting 11. Shaiboub also spent 90 minutes on the bench during APR draw against Gasogi, leaving the fans disappointed at full time as they sang his name. Asked about Shaiboub\u2019s snub, Froger revealed that selection of players was in his discretion and he cannot fill all the expatriate players. I\u2019ll say it again, it&#039;s my choice and there are regulations on foreign quota rule...It\u2019s not me who makes the regulations, there are eight foreign players and I am allowed to use only six (in the lineup), he explained.

Rwanda looked a more relaxed side as Jean Baptiste Kayiranga played tactically with skipper Kennedy Hoziana dictating the pace of the game. Uganda were playing with much pace with the attacking pair of Travis Mutyaba and Richard Okello causing problems for the Rwandan back four.

Standing at the bottom of the table with nine points after 12 games, the Nyamata-based side have a tough task to upset Police who have so far proven themselves as title contenders as they occupy the second position with 25 points just a point shy of leaders APR FC.

We beat Kiyovu 4-0 here and also drew 1-1 away with APR, Adams told Times Sport. We must just go all out and perform. We are very determined for this encounter and we shall get a good result. A win could lift Bugesera up from the drop zone depending on the other games involving Sunrise FC and Gorilla as well as Marines and Etoile.

The encounter could go either way considering the fact that Gasogi United is picking form and their talisman Theodor Malipangou is on fire. Gorilla will also host Sunrise FC at Kigali Pele Stadium with the home team being the firm favorites. Elsewhere, Amagaju will be at the Huye Stadium against Musanze FC.

It has been a good show so far for the junior Amavubi who secured their spot to the last four after defeating Sudan 3-0 on Friday in the last match of the group stages.

Overall, not many goals (13) were scored in the weekends while Gorilla FC, Gasogi United and Amagaju FC were the only teams who recorded away wins. Times Sport takes a look at five talking points from weekend action. The Hakizimana revolution continues Muhajiri Hakizimana had his mind set on playing for Iraqi outfit Zakho FC his move failed after Police reject the club\u2019s $70,000 bid to sign him in August. He was never happy since then and it affected his performance at the start of the season, leading to a fallout with his coach Vincent Mashami who on numerous occasions looked unimpressed by his displays. Hakizimana realized that things weren\u2019t going well when Frank Spittler snubbed him in the national team which was preparing for the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers against Zimbabwe and South Africa. The offensive midfielder has since worked hard to return to his top form during the international break and it now paying dividends for Police. He single-handedly made the difference as his brace helped Police FC beat Marines FC 2-1 at Kigali Pele Stadium on Saturday. With Hakizimana, Police FC have been looking unstoppable and his form could be decisive in club\u2019s quest for the first league title in their history. ALSO READ: Hakizimana hits double as Police FC beat Marines Musanze not the same without suspended Agblevor Musanze FC has been struggling without Ghanaian striker Peter Agblevor who has been serving suspension following a horror challenge on Yves Kimenyi on October 29, which led the AS Kigali shot stopper to need surgery on his torn tibia and fibula. Since Agblevor\u2019s suspension, Sosthene Habimana\u2019s side has not been the same team as their attacking line has been performing poorly upfront. Mohammed Sulley has chipped in some goals but the impact has been minimal as compared to Agblevor who has been a big miss for the Musanze-based side. The former Etoile de l&#039;Est talisman is Musanze FC\u2019s, live wire and, without him, they had surrendered the top spot, with APR FC leading the way. He was dearly missed as the club lost 1-0 at home to Gorilla at Ubworoherane Stadium on Saturday. It is evident that more misery could haunt Musanze FC as long as they don\u2019t have their goal poacher in attack. ALSO READ: Photos: Bugingo nets winner as Rayon pip Bugesera Muhazi United getting their things right Muhazi United endured a slow start to the Primus National League season, struggling to register a single win in their first six outings. They got their acts together and came out with some great results including a 2-1 away win over Eastern Province rivals Sunrise FC at Nyagatare Stadium on October 21. Etincelles on Sunday, Emmanuel Ruremesha\u2019s men came from behind to win 3-1, their biggest win this season. From all indications, the team, formerly Rwamagana City FC, are only getting even better as the season progresses. There is no stopping for Gilbert Mugisha After his exploits on international football duty with Amavubi in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Mugisha has been on fire ever since. The forward scored once and also set up a penalty in his last three matches. He has been APR&#039;s key player so far this season, whether he scores or not, he remains a nightmare for defenders. Mugisha remains one of the torchbearers of APR FC and he would be vital if they are to retain the league title. Title race might go down the wire After 12 league games, there is a pretty narrow gap between the four top teams with APR leading the standings with 26 points. They are closely followed by Vincent Mashami\u2019s Police FC with 25 as well as Rayon Sports and Musanze FC who are tied at 23 points in third and fourth places respectively. Meanwhile, four teams namely Amagaju, Kiyovu, Gasogi, and Mukura Victory Sports all have 17 points. The points gap is so close and it is evident that title race might go down to the final day as it did during the past two seasons. Now, only injuries and experience will make the difference in the decisive stages if any of the teams is to win the title.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID182": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-12-04T13:05:45+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-12-04T13:05:45+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-12-04T13:05:43+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12829/sports/football/players-abroad-bizimanas-fine-form-continues-as-ntwaris-galaxy-reach-cup-final", "headline": "Players Abroad: Bizimana\u2019s fine form continues as Ntwari\u2019s Galaxy reach cup final", "description": "It was yet another memorable weekend for Rwandan footballers plying their trade abroad as a number of them put up excellent performances in their...", "keywords": "Rwandan Players Abroad", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12829/sports/football/players-abroad-bizimanas-fine-form-continues-as-ntwaris-galaxy-reach-cup-final"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/04/35598.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/12/04/35598.jpg"}, "articleBody": "It was yet another memorable weekend for Rwandan footballers plying their trade abroad as a number of them put up excellent performances in their respective teams.

The \u2018Black and Yellow\u2019 side created some decent chances but their attacking trio of Mohammed Sylla, Elie Tatou Iradukunda and Zuber Hakizimana failed to find the back of the net. AS Kigali, who were without Andre Casa Mbungo who left the club this week, came into the game from the 30th minute mark with Fiston Ishimwe and Erisa Ssekisambu in the thick of affairs. The home side\u2019s pair of Herve Rugirayabo and skipper Latif Bishira were very dominant as, aside their defensive duties, they occasionally popped up to deliver balls in midfield.

She described the past two years as a great success for both sides. We are very pleased to continue our partnership with Rayon Sports. The past two years have been a success, and that&#039;s why we decided to extend for one more year, said TCHATCHOUA.

When I took on the role of club president, three years ago, our first ambition was to ensure the financial stability of our team. \u201cRayon Sports, being a fans-owned team, needs its reliable source of revenue, Uwayezu stated during a press conference on Friday. Rayon Sports recently announced a budget of approximately Rwf1 billion for the 2023/24 season. Uwayezu said that the new contract with CANAL+Rwanda is worth more than the previous one although specific details were kept confidential. I can&#039;t specifically mention the exact worth of this new contract due to confidentiality reasons, but what I can say is that it&#039;s bigger than last year, said Uwayezu. In addition to financial support, CANAL+Rwanda provides subscriptions for 45 Rayon Sports first-team players and committee members, as well as decoders and other equipment. Festive season CANAL+ Rwanda is offering some amazing festive season promotions! They have lowered the price of their decoders to just Rwf5,000, and that includes all the accessories like antennas, cables, and remote controls.

The unexpected success against South Africa has ignited aspirations of a potential miracle \u2013 qualifying for the World Cup.

Accumulating four points from the opening two fixtures, both played at home, was key and the least Amavubi had to settle for, thankfully, they did. Considering Nigeria\u2019s consistent performance at international football and South Africa\u2019s competitive standing, Rwanda must maintain their momentum and capitalize on every opportunity. Playing at the World Cup is nothing new to Rwanda\u2014the U-17 national team\u2019s previous World Cup appearance in 2011 showcases the country\u2019s potential, but the senior team faces a challenging road ahead. ALSO READ: Rwanda qualifies for Fifa U-17 World Cup Finals The journey to the World Cup finals tournament is often filled with twists and turns, and Rwanda\u2019s unexpected triumph over South Africa has sparked hopes of a potential miracle qualification. I call it a miracle, not that it\u2019s mission impossible but because no one, not even themselves, expects Amavubi to top the group. The fact that the team secured a goalless draw against Zimbabwe in their opening match further underscores their resilience and capability to compete at this level, under new coach Torsten Frank Spittler. Rwanda leads Group C table standing with four points, closely followed by South Africa with three points and Nigeria in third place with two points level with Lethoso and Zimbabwe while Benin currently sits bottom of the group with a single point. This sets the stage for a highly competitive battle for the top spot and the coveted World Cup qualification. What&#039;s more, Rwanda can finish second in the group and still remain in the race to the USA-Canada-Mexico showpiece, via playoffs, provided they have more points than any other second-placed teams from the other groups. Africa has been allocated ten spots (a two-fold increase), of which nine qualify automatically as group leaders and the 10th will go through playoffs. The FIFA play-off tournament will see six sides fight it out for the final two places. It will involve two teams from CONCACAF (North America) and one team apiece from the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONMEBOL (South America) and OFC (Oceania). According to FIFA, the four lowest-ranked nations will meet in bracket semi-finals. The two highest-ranked teams will go directly into the final. The winners of the two bracket finals will reach the FIFA World Cup. Nigeria, a football powerhouse in Africa, poses a formidable challenge for Rwanda. Despite being in third place, Nigeria\u2019s pedigree and experience make them a formidable opponent. For Rwanda, to secure qualification, they must approach the upcoming fixture against the Super Eagles with a strategic mindset, capitalizing on any weaknesses and maintaining the momentum gained from the victory over South Africa. South Africa is another crucial contender in the group. The loss to Rwanda is undoubtedly a setback, but they remain well-positioned to bounce back in the remaining fixtures. The return leg between Rwanda and South Africa will be pivotal in determining the group dynamics and could potentially shape the fate of both teams in the qualification race. Rwanda\u2019s chances of qualifying for the World Cup hinge not only on their individual performances but also on the outcomes of matches involving other teams in the group. With Nigeria drawing both their matches, the group appears to be open, providing an opportunity for Amavubi to capitalize on any slip-ups by their more illustrious competitors. Key factors that could influence Rwanda\u2019s qualification prospects include the team\u2019s consistency, tactical adaptability, and the ability to perform under pressure. The latter factor will be key. The support and enthusiasm of Rwandan fans are invaluable assets that can propel the team forward\u2014the joyous celebrations following the victory over South Africa is a testament to the emotional investment of the fans in the success of the national team. It\u2019s early days, and we can\u2019t start counting chicks before eggs hatch, but boy, Rwandans can enjoy Amavubi\u2019s position while it lasts, and yes, it may not be a wise idea to jump the gun but again, Amavubi fans are allowed to dare to dream, after all, that\u2019s what dreams are there for.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hamza Nkuutu"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID192": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-11-30T18:07:12+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-11-30T18:07:12+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-11-30T18:07:10+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12753/sports/football/rayon-sports-make-u-turn-on-youssefs-future", "headline": "Rayon Sports make U-turn on Youssef\u2019s future", "description": "Rayon Sports have decided to keep forward Youssef Rharb after fruitful talks on Wednesday.

APR, who knew a win would move them to the summit on the table standings, were in total control of the game from kickoff. They had their first chance in the fifth minute as Ismail Nshimirimana latched on to a superb ball from Alain Kwitonda but his effort flew over the post. Sunrise FC took long to settle in the game but they were able to string a couple of passes together though they failed to find their target man Yafesi Mubiru.

Nshimirimana elected himself to effect the free kick and he curled a sublime effort which hit the post to the relief of goalkeeper Didier Mfashingabo.

The referee pointed to the spot as he awarded a penalty to the army side. Mbaoma stepped up and sent Mfashingabo the wrong way to give APR a 1-0 lead in the 85th minute. APR pushed for the second goal to ensure safety for their three points but Sunrise stood resolute at the back until the referee blew his final whistle.

The match could have been suspended after just 35 minutes of action as rain flooded the pitch at Kigali Pel\u00e9 Stadium, but match officials decided to resume it after it stopped raining. Both teams started the game brightly but it was Rayon Sports who looked the more purposeful side with their direct attacking play. ALSO READ: Aboubakar insists Police must beat Rayon to maintain winning streak Rayon piled pressure on Police defense early on, pushing for an opener; their efforts paid dividends after just eight minutes as left-back Hakim Bugingo set up Musa Esenu who made no mistake to beat goalkeeper Onesime Rukundo to the ball to give the visitors an early lead. With the Blues leading 1-0, Police stepped up their game as they sought for the equalizer. They had a glorious chance in the 19th minute as Muhadjiri Hakizimana stole the ball from Eric Ngendahimana from the midfield. His pass found Didier Mugisha but the striker&#039;s effort hit the post to the relief of the Rayon\u2019s fans. Despite being a goal down, Vincent Mashami\u2019s men tried to drag the Rayon Sports players out so that they could exploit the spaces at the back in an attempt to equalize. Hesbone Rutonesha\u2019s pass found Abedi Bigirimana who also located Hakizimana with a one-time delivery before firing a shot which was saved by Rayon goalkeeper Simon Tamale. Police FC were dominating ball possession until match officials had to temporarily suspend the game after 35 minutes of action as the pitch was waterlogged due to heavy rains. As soon as it stopped raining, match officials and coaches from both sides agreed to resume the match instead of suspending it to the next day just like Kiyovu and Sunrise did over the weekend. There were no further chances in the final 10 minutes of the first half as both teams went for a half time break with Rayon leading 1-0. The second half saw coach Mohammed Wade bringing on Rashid Kalisa for Roger Kanamugire as he sought to stabilize his midfield. Police FC tried to use the pace of skipper Dominique Savio Nshuti on the flanks to great effects as he proved to be a tough customer for Blues defenders. Rayon launched an attack pushing to double the lead but Joackiam Ojera was denied a penalty as he claimed that defender Ally Kwitonda brought him down while clearing the danger. Head coach of Rayon Wade was not happy with the decision as he questioned the referee and got a yellow card. Police never ceased to press as they tried to get an equalizer and, to soak pressure, Wade introduced Elie Ganijuru in the 75th minute to replace Charles Bbaale who failed to impress in as the tactician opted to only play on counterattacks. With two minutes to end the game, Heritier Luvumbu punished Police in the 88th minute with the second goal as he put the game beyond the reach of the law enforcers. A 2-0 scoreline was too difficult for Police to put up a turnaround. But the player kept believing in a comeback the time Abedi Bigirimana pulled one back for Police FC in the 93rd minute. However, Rayon held on to defend their lead until referee Jean Paul Ngabonziza blew the final whistle after four minutes of additional time. The result saw Rayon keep their fourth position on the table with 20 points, three points adrift of table leaders Musanze FC.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Edmund Okai Gyimah"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/", "https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg"], "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png", "width": 270, "height": 57}}, "copyrightHolder": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The New Times", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/"}}, "ID201": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "dateCreated": "2023-11-28T14:01:16+02:00", "datePublished": "2023-11-28T14:01:16+02:00", "dateModified": "2023-11-28T14:01:14+02:00", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12689/sports/football/aboubakar-insists-police-must-beat-rayon-to-maintain-winning-streak", "headline": "Aboubakar insists Police must beat Rayon to maintain winning streak", "description": "Police FC midfielder Djibrine Aboubakar Akuki insists his side must do all they can to beat Rayon Sports to maintain their unbeaten run in the Primus...", "keywords": "Primus National League,Police FC,Aboubakar Djibrine Akuki,Rayon Sports", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/12689/sports/football/aboubakar-insists-police-must-beat-rayon-to-maintain-winning-streak"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/11/28/35136.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/11/28/35136.jpg"}, "articleBody": "Police FC midfielder Djibrine Aboubakar Akuki insists his side must do all they can to beat Rayon Sports to maintain their unbeaten run in the Primus National League.

The Tanzanian forces\u2019 side started with a clear plan to defend as they sat deep in a compact 5- 4- 1 formation and allowed possession but leaving no space for the opponents to score while at the same time building their game counterattacks.

APR&#039;s midfield was marshalled around Sharaf Eldin Shaiboub who was playing his first game after returning from injury. The Sudanese midfielder was the engine of the military side as he drove the team forward with his commanding display which included his ability to support both the defense and the attack.

Innocent Nshuti stepped up but saw his penalty saved by AS Kigali goalkeeper Niyonkuru. That was few minutes after the striker had his goal ruled out after Victor Mbaoma fouled Niyonkuru before Nshuti scored.

The November qualifiers leave Rwanda with head held high at the top of Group C standing after collecting four points from two matches.

ALSO READ: 2026 WC Qualifiers: Nshuti and Mugisha fire Rwanda past South Africa The recent results have not only boosted confidence among Spittler\u2019s men in the dressing room but it also caught the attention of nation\u2019s football legends who continue to show support to the team that bigger things will come if they keep momentum in the future outings against group opponents Nigeria, Lesotho, and Benin. Rejoice! Veteran D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mbonabucya captained Rwanda at the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Tunisia, the only appearance the country has ever made at the continent\u2019s most prestigious football event. The Belgium-based legend watched from the stands when Innocent Nshuti and Gilbert Mugisha punish Bafana Bafana in two big moments that reminded him of the time Amavubi stunned Uganda and Ghana to qualify for the AFCON finals. Mbonabucya, who last watched Rwanda playing back in years, said the current group can replicate the 2004 Amavubi glory days and beat anyone regardless of being underdogs in the group. I can\u2019t hide my satisfaction with the way we were going about our business against South Africa. We can build on this win against one of the best teams in Africa and do better in the next matches, the former Sint-Truiden defender said. And, despite being snubbed from featuring in the Rwandan squad recently, Singida stars striker Meddie Kagere could barely hide his emotions after learning that his country stunned South Africa. Kagere, who has been playing for the national team for a over a decade, a admits it is a result he never expected considering the pain of defeats that the country had experienced for a couple of years, putting many on the edge of losing hope for results. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s the result that every Rwandan wanted but no one was expecting that performance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got wise players who are playing very well, especially in the first half. The football, they played, bringing it out from the back, creating many passes, and moving the ball was the best football that team was playing, I am happy for the young boys,\u201d former Police, Rayon Sports and Simba FC noted. ALSO READ: Emotional Nshuti overwhelmed after scoring against South Africa \u201cBeating South Africa 2-0 is something big for our young guns but they still have a long way to go so they must be ready for the next matches.\u201d Keep that momentum! Celebrations are for winners and no one wants to see the atmosphere witnessed at Huye Stadium this week evading. Spittler will need to keep doing his job right and so should the players. Then Rwandans will give them the backing in their capacity to get to needed results which have been missing for quite some time. We have to support these boys because they have shown that they are capable of winning many games and I think everyone in Rwanda is happy so I am happy for them and I am looking forward to seeing boys winning many games, Mbonabucya said. Moving forward, former Amavubi defensive midfielder Jean-Baptiste &#039;Migi&#039; Mugiraneza said that it is time to think on how Rwanda can build the momentum and get used to winning more games. \u201cIt is something to rejoice as Rwandans because it has been so long without winning at home with better performance. All I can tell the boys is to keep working hard because anything can happen if they keep working hard for the next matches,\u201d the Musanze FC assistant coach told Weekend Sport. \u201cWe saw Amavubi which is different from the past, I saw different football. They attacked, they are united and they worked hard but they are not that far yet, they have to prepare their mind since they showed that they can beat every team in this group.\u201d You can beat anyone! With that stunning win over South Africa, Rwanda sent a strong message to Group C rivals, including qualification favorites Nigeria, that anyone can taste a similar result against the \u2018underdogs.\u2019 Rwanda&#039;s most capped player Haruna Niyonzima said that the team can beat anyone if they maintain fitness and creativity. \u201cAn exciting young side has captured the imagination of a nation starved of success for far too long. We can actually build on that win because we have shown what we are capable of against any team. I am looking forward to seeing Amavubi win more games in the World Cup qualifiers,\u201d Niyonzima said.

I told him he would come on when the South Africans are exhausted and he understood it professionally, the German explained.
